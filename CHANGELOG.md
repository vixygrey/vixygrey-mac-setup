## [7.23.0] - 2026-09-09

A small release, and one where the interesting work was in the checks rather than the features.

`zellij --layout home` is a personal dashboard: a plain shell on the left, with weather, `btop`, and a tiki over the personal notes stacked down the right. omp gains a turn counter above the prompt, adopts six settings that had been set by hand on the machine, and turns the always-on advisor off.

The turn counter was not built the way it was asked for, and that is the point. `ctx.ui.setStatus()` is the API the request implies, and it cannot carry colour: the footer strips ANSI from status text and renders the joined statuses with no theme applied. `setWidget` with `placement: "aboveEditor"` renders in the same place and does carry colour, so the widget takes its palette from the live theme rather than from hardcoded hex.

Two checks in this release exist because the obvious version of them would have proved nothing. The new CI row that parses the omp extension copies the extraction to a `.ts` name first, because `bun build` on the extensionless file the harness writes accepts deliberately broken TypeScript. And `turnIndex` is displayed one-based because a probe extension was run for one real turn to find out it is zero-based, rather than guessing.

Three documents still described pi as a live second agent, four releases after it was retired. `specs/adr/0001` names the same path and is deliberately untouched: it records what was true when a decision was taken, and that decision has not changed.

### Added

- **`lsp.diagnosticsOnEdit` is enabled for omp** (#527). Diagnostics now run as omp edits rather than only when it writes. The three features it sits beside need no configuration at all: omp ships `lsp.enabled` and `debug.enabled` on, and `edit.mode` already defaults to `hashline`. This one defaults to off.

- **omp: hand-made config keys adopted, the always-on advisor turned off, and a turn-counter widget** (#525).

  Six keys had been set by hand on the machine and are now written by the generator: `composer.shape`, `github.enabled`, `symbolPreset` (`nerd`, since this machine installs the nerd fonts), `theme.light` (the generator had only ever set `theme.dark`, so a light terminal background fell back to omp's stock theme), and a `retry.fallbackChains.smol` chain so the cheap fan-out role degrades to the next cheapest model rather than the default chain's more expensive one.

  **`advisor.enabled` is written as `false`.** The advisor is a second model watching every turn, and it is off deliberately. Writing the value rather than omitting it is the point: the schema default is already `false`, but an explicit value records the decision and survives an upstream default change. `modelRoles.advisor` stays on Pro, which costs nothing while this is off and is the right assignment if it is switched on.

  **`setupVersion` is deliberately not adopted.** It is omp's own bookkeeping, written by `omp setup` to record that onboarding ran. It is state omp owns rather than a preference, and the generator asserting it would claim something about a machine it did not set up. The `yq` merge leaves it untouched.

  **The turn counter is a widget, not a status.** `ctx.ui.setStatus()` is the obvious-looking API and is the wrong one: the footer documents that it strips ANSI and control characters, and `footer.ts` pushes the joined extension statuses as a plain line with no theme colour applied at all. Nothing set through it can be styled. `ctx.ui.setWidget(key, content, { placement: "aboveEditor" })` renders where the counter is wanted and can carry colour, so that is what it uses.

  Colours come from `ctx.ui.theme.fg(token, text)` against the core `muted` and `statusLineContext` tokens, not hardcoded hex. It is Dracula-Sakura because that is what `config.yml` selects, and it follows the theme if that changes.

  **`turnIndex` is zero-based**, established by observation rather than assumption: a probe extension recorded `turnIndex=0` from both `turn_start` and `turn_end` on the first turn of a real session. The widget adds one, because "turn 0" is not what a human means by turns used. That probe also proved the loading path — `~/.omp/agent/extensions/` is auto-discovered for `.ts` and `.js`, so the file needs no registration.

- **A `home` zellij layout, beside the existing `dev` one** (#523). A personal dashboard for a full-screen terminal: a plain shell on the left, and weather, system monitor, and notes stacked down the right.

  ```
  +---------------------+----------------------+
  |                     |  starlit  (weather)  |  25%
  |                     +----------------------+
  |   plain terminal    |  btop  (system)      |  25%
  |                     +----------------------+
  |                     |  tiki  (notes)       |  50%
  +---------------------+----------------------+
  ```

  Three command choices are not obvious, and each is recorded in the layout:

  - `starlit --interactive`, not bare `starlit`. The bare form prints one forecast and exits, which leaves a dead pane.
  - `tiki` with `cwd` pinned to `~/Documents/notes`. It opens the Markdown in whatever directory it starts in, so a dashboard launched from a random path would otherwise show that path's files. `~` in a pane `cwd` is expanded: zellij's `parse_path` runs every path property through `shellexpand::full` (`kdl_layout_parser.rs:418-430`), and pane `cwd` goes through it.
  - The `tab-bar` and `status-bar` panes are declared explicitly, the #481 lesson. A custom layout replaces the default wholesale, and those bars are ordinary plugin panes rather than implicit chrome.

  `starlit` needs one manual step before the weather pane is useful: `starlit --setup`, then an API key in the config it creates. That is a credential, so the generator does not write it. The post-setup checklist says so.

### Fixed

- **CI now syntax-checks the omp turn-counter extension, and the check can actually fail** (#527). The `generated-config` job parses 50-odd heredocs; the TypeScript extension added in #525 was not among them, so a syntax error in it would have passed CI and failed on a machine at load time. Most heredocs legitimately have no row, because the job adds one where a generated file has a real parser and Markdown has none. TypeScript has one, so this was a gap rather than an accepted omission.

  **The row copies the extraction to a `.ts` name first, and that is load-bearing.** The harness extracts to `/tmp/generated` with no extension, and `bun build /tmp/generated --no-bundle` **accepts deliberately broken TypeScript**: bun treats an unknown extension as an asset to copy rather than source to parse. Written the obvious way the row could never fail, which is exactly the vacuous pass the job's empty-extraction guard already exists to prevent. Both forms were run against a deliberately broken copy before the row was added; only the `.ts` form rejects it. `bun` is the right parser here regardless of availability, because omp declares `engines.bun` and so it is the runtime that will actually load the file.

- **Stale `pi` references in three documents** (#527). `specs/state.yaml`, `README.md`, and `docs/GUIDE.md` still described pi as a live second agent writing `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`, which the script stopped doing when pi was retired in #513. All three were live claims about current behavior rather than history.

  `specs/adr/0001` also names that path and is deliberately unchanged. It appears in that ADR's Context section, recording what was true when the decision was taken, and `specs/adr/README.md` says to supersede an ADR rather than edit it. The decision itself — edit the generator, never the output — has not changed, so there is nothing to supersede either. Editing an ADR to tidy a dated example would damage the record it exists to keep.

## [7.22.0] - 2026-09-09

A release that removes more than it adds, and is better for it.

pi is retired. omp is its own fork, so almost everything the pi block generated turned out to be a native omp feature rather than something to port: a 300-line SearXNG extension became two config keys, local Ollama discovery became nothing at all, and the safety extensions became approval-mode settings. The five Tiki skills and the shared skills bridge moved across intact. The `mac-bloat` category went too, having existed to remove one app macOS no longer preinstalls.

The result is that `macos-defaults` is now the only category that needs a password, and it only asks when it has privileged work pending. A converged machine can complete a full unattended run for the first time.

Two defects were found by running the thing rather than reading it. `pmset dim` is a deprecated alias for `displaysleep`, so one block had been silently overwriting another's display-sleep policy while both reported success. And Homebrew's removed node had left 19 packages and 1.6 GB behind, with 31 live symlinks still pointing into them.

Seven more tools carry the Dracula-Sakura palette, and fifteen are now recorded as unable to, with the reason for each. That second list is the more useful one: it stops the same tools being re-investigated every few releases.

A theme running through the whole release is that no error is not evidence. atuin accepted an invalid colour in silence. nushell accepts unknown colour keys without complaint, which left two of them dead. `nu -c` does not load `config.nu` at all, so reading a value back that way returns the default and looks like a config the tool is ignoring. Every check here now has a control: a deliberately invalid value has to be rejected before acceptance means anything.

### Added

- **Three more tools carry the palette, and the rest are recorded as unable to** (#519). The second tier from #518, investigated rather than assumed. Two of the three had been written off as low-confidence guesses in the first survey and turned out to be the best candidates in the set.

  **stu** gets 19 `ui.theme.*` keys in `~/.stu/config.toml`. Its docs record that colours deserialize through Ratatouille's `Color` serde, which accepts named, indexed, and hex values. `object_dir_bold` sits in the same table and is a **bool**, not a colour, which would have been a type error treated as one. stu does not follow XDG: `$STU_ROOT_DIR` defaults to `~/.stu`.

  **e1s** gets 11 hex overrides in `~/.config/e1s/config.yml`. It also accepts `--theme dracula` from a built-in set; the overrides are used instead, because the built-in is Dracula and the house palette is the sakura variant of it.

  **lazyenv** gets the built-in `dracula` preset. It ships 56 themes and offers no way to define a palette, so this is honestly Dracula rather than Dracula-Sakura, and the comment says so. It also **ignores `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` entirely**: `lazyenv --check-config` reports the same three search paths with and without the variable set, and the only per-user one is under `Library/Application Support`. That makes it a deliberate Library case like ngrok (#334), not a candidate for the `~/.config` sweep in #333.

  **Fifteen tools are recorded as unable to take the theme,** with the reason, in a new README table. `duf` and `taproom` offer preset flags with no Dracula among them. `fx` has numbered built-ins and no custom definition. `procs` and `nnn` are indexed-colour only, so the palette could only be approximated. The remaining ten document no theming at all. Writing this down is the point: it stops the same tools being re-investigated every few releases.

  **`lazyenv` gets a `--verify` row; `stu` and `e1s` deliberately do not.** `lazyenv --check-config` prints `Config OK` and reports errors for an unknown theme, so a pass means it parsed and accepted the theme. The other two are TUIs with no validate mode, and without a TTY they panic inside crossterm before config parsing is reached. A correct config and a deliberately broken one produce the identical panic, so a row built on that would report nothing about the config. Their configs are written at the documented paths in the documented format, and that is the honest limit of what was verified.

- **Four more tools carry the Dracula-Sakura palette: lnav, nushell, atuin, and pgcli/mycli** (#518). Each accepted a custom theme and had none. Every mechanism was verified against the tool or its source rather than its documentation, and each check was run with a control, because three of the four accept an invalid value in silence.

  **lnav** gets a full `theme-def`: 151 values across `styles`, `syntax-styles`, `status-styles`, and `log-level-styles`. It ships a built-in `dracula`, which was the cheap option and not taken, because plain Dracula lacks the rose and lilac accents that make the house palette what it is. The theme is a config **fragment** under `~/.config/lnav/configs/dev-setup/`, because lnav rewrites its own `config.json`: one `:config` command makes it dump `tuning`, `theme-defs`, and `log.demux` into that file. Same rule as omp's `config.yml`, never own the file the tool owns. Selection goes through lnav's own `:config` writer.

  **nushell** gets 59 `color_config` keys in a `config.nu` this script had never written. Until now it wrote `env.nu` only, so nushell ran stock colours while every other TUI carried the palette.

  **atuin** gets a 15-token theme file. The `Meaning` enum in `atuin-client/src/theme.rs` defines fifteen tokens. The help text embedded in the binary lists seven and says values must be "lowercase entries" from the palette named-colour index, which reads as named-only. The parser disagrees: it checks for a leading `#` and reads hex pairs before falling back to named lookup, so the real palette is usable rather than approximated from CSS colour names.

  **pgcli and mycli** move from `syntax_style = monokai`, commented "Dracula-ish", to `dracula`, which is a real Pygments style and present in this install. pgcli also gains a `[colors]` block for the completion menu, toolbar, and search chrome that a Pygments style never touches.

  **Three traps are recorded in comments where they apply,** because each produced a false reading first:

  - `nu -c '...'` does **not** load `config.nu`. Reading a colour back that way returns nushell's default and looks exactly like a config the tool ignores. The correct check names the file: `nu --config ~/.config/nushell/config.nu -c '...'`.
  - nushell accepts **unknown** colour keys in silence, so a typo is a line that does nothing rather than an error. `date` and `custom` were wrong here until the keys were diffed against `$env.config.color_config | columns`. The real names are `datetime` and `shape_custom`.
  - `lnav` refuses `/dev/null` with "unable to open file ... Invalid argument", so the selection step needs a real one-line temp file. Passing `/dev/null` failed the step on a real run while the theme itself was perfectly good.

  The reason every check has a control: feeding atuin a theme containing `Base = "zzz-not-a-colour"` produced no error at all, because the command being run never rendered a theme. Acceptance only means something once the tool is shown to reject a bad value.

### Removed



- **pi is retired; omp inherits everything it carried** (#513). omp is a fork of pi, so most of what the pi block generated is now a native omp feature rather than something to port. The install, the ~1290-line config block, and the `--verify` row are gone.

  What omp already did natively, and therefore what was deleted rather than moved:

  | pi generated | omp equivalent |
  | --- | --- |
  | `extensions/searxng-web.ts`, about 300 lines of TypeScript, plus its skill | `searxng` is one of 23 built-in `web_search` backends, configured with `searxng.endpoint` |
  | `models.json` registering four local Ollama models | native `ollama` provider with local discovery, key optional |
  | `themes/dracula-sakura.json` | omp has its own, authored against its own schema |
  | `AGENTS.md`, `settings.json` | already generated for omp, from the same emitters |

  The SearXNG swap is the clearest of these: a hand-written tool became two lines of config pointing at the same instance, and the keyless backends stay behind it so search still works when the instance is down.

  **Three things moved rather than went.** The five Tiki companion skills (`tiki-capture`, `tiki-review`, `tiki-groom`, `tiki-arc`, `tiki-journal`) now generate into `~/.omp/agent/skills/`, omp's native skills location. The `~/.agents/skills` bridge moved into the omp block, unchanged, because that directory was always omp's own canonical location rather than something pi lent it. And the Claude Code bigpowers link moved out intact: it lived inside the pi block but only ever ran bigpowers' `installGlobal` helper for the `claude` target. Only pi's `packages` pinning was actually pi-coupled, and that went with pi.

  **`--cleanup` removes pi and sweeps `~/.pi`,** through the two mechanisms that already existed. `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` gets an `npm:` row, and `CONFIG_ORPHANS` gets `pi|$HOME/.pi|omp`. That list is guarded on binary presence and runs after the uninstall loop, so one invocation uninstalls the package and then sweeps the directory in the same pass, through `trash` rather than `rm -rf`. Both guards in `CONVENTIONS.md` section 15 are satisfied without new code.

  CAUTION: `~/.pi` holds content this generator never wrote. Six hand-placed extensions, an `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, a second theme, `auth.json`, and session history. Removing it is deliberate and was chosen explicitly. It goes to the Trash, so it is recoverable from Finder until that is emptied. Most of those extensions were approximations of things omp has as first-class settings: `permission-gate`, `confirm-destructive`, and `protected-paths` are what `tools.approvalMode`, `tools.approval.<tool>`, and `bash.patterns` do natively, with built-in rules for the critical destructive patterns.

  One test was inverted. `tests/cleanup-npm.bats` asserted that pi must **not** carry a `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` row, citing #399: pi was a supported second agent, so reinstalling it by hand was legitimate and `--cleanup` had to leave it alone. That reasoning ended with the retirement, which is the same call already made for tmux, helix, and aider. A second test pins that `~/.pi` is swept by `CONFIG_ORPHANS` rather than by a bespoke `rm`.

  `emit_agent_preferences` keeps its harness-name argument despite now having one consumer. The body is 50 lines of prose and the heading is the only part that varies, so a future second harness costs one call rather than a copy that drifts.



- **The `mac-bloat` category** (#509). It removed exactly one app, GarageBand, which modern macOS does not preinstall. On a clean machine the category found nothing and reported `GarageBand — not found`, which is what it reported on the maintainer's machine.

  For that it cost an entry in `ALL_CATEGORIES`, a line in the interactive picker, about 45 lines of work block, and one of only **two** entries in `SUDO_CATEGORY_REASON`, which made it one of two reasons a run ever asked for a password. It also aimed at a shrinking target: everything Apple still bundles lives under `/System/Applications`, which needs SIP disabled and is out of scope here by decision (`specs/adr/0007-macos-only.md`).

  `--only mac-bloat` and `--skip mac-bloat` now exit non-zero with `Unknown category`. That is the intended outcome rather than a regression: the category validator already rejects unknown names loudly, and a name that is silently accepted while doing nothing is worse. Removing the app by hand, on the rare machine that has it, is `sudo rm -rf /Applications/GarageBand.app`.

  The useful consequence is that **`macos-defaults` is now the only category that needs a password at all.** Together with #502, a machine whose system settings are converged never invokes `sudo`, so a full unattended run is possible for the first time.

### Fixed



- **`--cleanup` sweeps the global npm tree Homebrew's removed node left behind** (#515). #344 removed Homebrew's `node`. It did not remove the tree that node had created, so a machine provisioned before that change still carried 19 packages and 1.6 GB at `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib/node_modules`, with no `node` in that prefix to use them.

  It was not inert. **31 live symlinks** in `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin` still pointed into it — `claude`, `tsc`, `cdk`, `turbo`, `ni`, `lighthouse`, `mmdc`, `carbonyl` and more. Every one resolved, and their shebangs find `node` through `PATH`, so they would execute the **old tree's code** against mise's node. None of the 19 was an installed formula; `brew list --formula` claimed none of them. They were leftovers of `npm install -g` under the node that #344 removed.

  Versions happened to match mise's tree exactly at the time this was found, which is timing rather than safety. `npm_global_install` only ever writes to mise's tree, so the two diverge at the first upgrade, and which copy runs then depends on `PATH` order in the calling context. That is the #343 defect, and the same shape #513 found with pi installed under both npm and pnpm.

  **The guard is that the prefix has no node at all.** `lib/node_modules` is npm's global root for that prefix's node, so while the formula is installed the tree is live and must not be touched. A run with a node present says so and declines. Removal goes through `trash`, and the bin links are removed before the tree, because a link into a directory that no longer exists is worse than either end of the operation alone.

  Links are selected by **target**, never by name: anything else in that directory belongs to a formula, and a name list would go stale the moment a package is added. `orphaned_brew_node_links` lives in the tested helper layer for that reason, with five tests covering the cases that matter — a link into `lib/node_modules` is selected, a formula's own link is not, a real file is not, a missing `bin` directory is a no-op, and a mixed directory yields only the node link.

  This is the "retiring a tool is not the same as cleaning up after it" lesson (#210, #214, #224) applied to the one case that had it backwards: the tool was removed and its data was not.





- **`just verify` reported two failures that were checks pointing at nothing** (#505). The `git` and `direnv` rows named addresses this script does not write, so both reported `MISSING` on every machine, forever. The files were correct and the tools were reading them. `--verify` now reports `Failed: 0` and exits 0.

  This is the inverse of the #329 and #332 shape the pass exists to catch. There the config was valid and unread; here the config was valid and read, and the check was wrong. The cost is the same either way, and it is the #327 lesson: two permanent failures are noise, and noise hides the real ones.

  **`direnv` was wrong twice.** It named `direnvrc`, which this script does not write, and its extractor looked for a `DirenvRC:` field that `direnv status` does not emit. It is now a `validate` row against `direnv.toml`, testing that `whitelist.prefix` is non-empty. That is the stronger question: a default direnv prints `whitelist.prefix []`, so a non-empty one proves direnv **loaded our file** rather than merely looked in the right folder.

  **`git` keeps `~/.gitconfig`, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut.** The obvious alternative was to move to `~/.config/git/config` for consistency with every other config here. Git does honor XDG for `--global` writes, but only when `~/.gitconfig` does not exist; with one present it always wins, verified against git 2.55. Every provisioned machine already has one, holding the identity, the `includeIf` routing, and any hand edits. Moving to XDG would mean relocating a file this script did not write and cannot prove is ours, which is the test `write_managed` applies before it removes anything. The row now names the file git actually uses.

- **Four `--verify` rows could fail on a tool that prints too much** (#505). Found while fixing the row above, and the more useful half. Rows written as `<tool> | grep -q <pattern>` are unsafe under `set -o pipefail`, which this script sets globally: `grep -q` exits at the first match, the tool ahead of it takes SIGPIPE while still writing, and the pipeline returns 141. The row then reports that the tool rejected its config, which is the opposite of what happened.

  `direnv` failed this way on every run, because `direnv status` keeps printing after the matched line. `pi`, `omp`, and `zellij` shared the shape and passed only because their output was short enough to finish first. That is luck, not correctness: any of them would start failing the day the tool grew one more line of output.

  All four now go through `_verify_output_has`, which captures the output and matches it with a here-string, the pattern `_verify_asciinema` already used. The helper sits in the tested helper layer rather than inside the verify function, so the bug has a regression test. A test also pins the diagnosis by asserting the old piped form really does return 141, and another rejects any future row written the old way.



- **A password is asked for only when there is privileged work to do** (#502). `sudo_reasons()` asked whether a category was *selected*, not whether it had *work to do*, so preflight ran `sudo -v` before anything had checked. A run of `--only macos-defaults,mac-bloat` on a converged machine typed a password and then reported that Touch ID, DNS, and Siri were all already configured and that GarageBand was not installed.

  The larger cost was not the wasted keystroke. `macos-defaults` and `mac-bloat` are the only categories that need root, so an unattended run could not do a full setup at all. An agent, a launchd job, or a `topgrade` step had to skip them and hope somebody ran them by hand later.

  Each sudo-needing category now has a predicate, and `sudo_reasons()` dispatches on that instead of on `should_run`. Every check is the **read half of a guard the work block already applies**, which is the property that matters: if detection and application could disagree, a wrong "already done" would silently skip a system setting, and that is worse than one unnecessary prompt. A category listed in `SUDO_CATEGORY_REASON` with no predicate now fails at startup rather than resolving to "no sudo needed" and dying mid-work at a password prompt, which is the same loud-default discipline `CONFIG_LIVES_IN_CONFIGS` already carries.

  `BLOAT_APPS` moves up to the category tables, because the predicate reads it during preflight and the work block runs much later. One array with two readers, rather than a copy that could drift from the list actually being removed.

  **Two settings needed something other than a plain read.** `systemsetup -getusingnetworktime` needs administrator access to *read*, so detecting it would cost the very password this change avoids. `mark_done` and `is_done` could not serve, despite existing for adjacent reasons: the state file is truncated on every non-resume run, and `is_done` answers false unless `--resume` was passed. Both are correct for resume and wrong for "did any previous run ever apply this". So `priv_mark` and `priv_done` were added, deliberately separate. The trade is stated in the comment: turn one of these off by hand and the run will not notice, and deleting the line from `~/.local/share/dev-setup/privileged-applied.txt` forces a re-apply. The work block still runs the command whenever it executes, so any run that obtains sudo for another reason re-applies it for free.

  `/Volumes` visibility is detected with `/bin/ls -ldO`, not `ls -ldO`. The coreutils install shadows BSD `ls`, and GNU `ls` rejects `-O` with `invalid option`, which reads like a permission problem and is not one.

  **The prompt now names the pending work, not the category.** The first version of this fix still printed the whole `SUDO_CATEGORY_REASON` blurb, so a run that needed only the display sleep timers announced "display sleep, DNS servers, startup chime, network time and Touch ID for sudo" and asked for a password. Four of those five were already applied. A request that names work it will not do cannot be judged any better than one that names nothing, which is the problem #269 fixed from the other side. Each predicate now returns the specific items it found pending, and those are what the prompt lists.

- **`pmset dim` overwrote the display sleep the same category had just set** (#508). `dim` is not a separate setting. The man page records it as a deprecated alias for `displaysleep`, kept working since 10.4. The first `macos-defaults` block set 120 minutes on the charger and 75 on battery; the second block then ran `pmset -c dim 30` and `pmset -b dim 30` about 4000 lines later and reset both to 30. Both blocks reported success, so every run claimed a two-hour display sleep and applied thirty minutes. A provisioned machine at 7.21.0 read `displaysleep 30` under both power sources.

  Display sleep now belongs to the earlier block alone. The second keeps `halfdim`, which is a genuinely separate setting, and its message describes that instead of a "screen dim" that was never what the line did.

  This is the #241/#242 shape again: two names for one thing, treated as two things. It was found while writing the #502 predicates, and the two had to be fixed together, because a predicate cannot be written against two lines that contradict each other. There is no single target value to compare against.

  Detection note for anyone touching this later: `halfdim` reads back as `lessbright`, and `pmset -g custom` reports it only in the `Battery Power` section.

## [7.21.0] - 2026-09-09

A release about adding a third agent without letting the three drift apart.

`omp` joins Claude Code and pi. It is the maximalist fork of pi, and this setup routes it at Google Gemini, so the machine now has a local-first small harness, a Gemini-routed large one, and Claude Code for anything that needs MCP.

The work that mattered was not the install. It was proving that "same theme, same AGENTS.md, same skills" is true rather than approximately true. The preferences body became one emitter with two consumers, because two heredocs drift the first time one is edited alone. The generated pi file is byte-identical to what 7.20.1 produced, which is the evidence that the refactor cost pi nothing.

Three upstream facts changed the implementation, and each was found by reading the tool rather than by assuming the fork inherited pi's shape. Its `config.yml` is written by omp itself, so this setup merges into it instead of owning it. Its `google` and `gemini` provider ids mean different things. And its own shipped theme sets two color tokens that its runtime schema rejects, which a custom theme file cannot get away with.

The theme was then verified by rendering it rather than by parsing it. `omp gallery` emits the Dracula-Sakura palette and none of the built-in control colors, so the file is loading and not falling back.

### Added

- **Oh My Pi (`omp`) as a third agent harness, routed at Google Gemini** (#504). `omp` is the maximalist fork of pi by can1357: 32 built-in tools, 13 LSP operations, a real debugger over DAP, subagents, and nine model roles that route by intent. It joins Claude Code and pi rather than replacing either.

  The configuration is a near one-to-one parallel of the pi block, so it reuses the doctrine already in the script. `~/.omp/agent` is the one path family, the same way `~/.pi/agent` is for pi. The theme is the same Dracula-Sakura palette. The `AGENTS.md` preferences and the Simplified Technical English writing rules are the same text, from the same generators.

  **The preferences body is now one emitter with two consumers.** `emit_agent_preferences` takes the harness name and writes everything that was previously inside pi's `PI_AGENTS_CONF` heredoc. Nothing in that body was ever pi-specific except the heading. A second copy would drift the first time one was edited alone, which is the reasoning that already made `emit_writing_rules` a function in #491. The generated `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` is byte-identical to the version 7.20.1 produced.

  **Installed from the `can1357/tap` Homebrew tap, not npm.** The npm package declares `engines.bun >= 1.3.14`, so it is a Bun program and `npm_global_install` cannot serve it. The tap also puts a prebuilt native binary in `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin`, which is on the `PATH` of `sh`, git hooks, and launchd. A mise-managed or npm-managed copy is not, which is the #345 lesson applied before it could cost anything.

  Nine roles carry three models. `default`, `task`, and `vision` use `gemini-3.8-flash`. `slow`, `plan`, and `advisor` use `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. `smol`, `tiny`, and `commit` use `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. Every id is verified against the catalog omp ships. `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is the only Gemini Pro on the API today, and a preview id can be retired without notice, so `retry.fallbackChains` pins an exact-model fallback to Flash for the three roles that use it.

  Note that `gemini-3.1-pro` without the suffix is a different thing. Only `cursor`, `google-antigravity`, and `opencode-zen` serve that id. The direct `google` provider, `google-vertex`, and `google-gemini-cli` all carry the preview id instead.

  **Authentication stays user-owned.** The `google` provider reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the environment. This script never reads, writes, or echoes a key, which matches how the pi block treats `auth.json`. A run with no key set says so once instead of finishing quietly with no reachable model.

  Three findings shaped the implementation, and each is recorded as a comment where it applies:

  - **`config.yml` is merged, never written as a managed block.** `omp config set`, `omp config reset`, and `/settings` all write that file through omp's own YAML serializer, which would not preserve managed-block markers. The merge uses `yq` and touches only our keys, the same shape as the pi `models.json` merge with `jq`. omp re-reads the file under a lock when it saves, so an external edit survives an open session.
  - **`google` is the model provider and `gemini` is a discovery provider.** The two ids share one namespace. `gemini` is the source that reads `GEMINI.md`, so configuring it in place of `google` does nothing visible. This is the section 14 "one vocabulary" smell, named in the comment so the next reader does not have to rediscover it.
  - **The theme omits `link` and `toolText`.** omp's shipped `dark-dracula` theme sets both, but neither appears in the runtime schema, and both the schema mirror and its `colors` object declare `additionalProperties: false`. Built-in themes are compiled in; a custom theme file is validated. An unknown key would sink the whole file to a silent fallback, which is the exact "valid config that nobody reads" class from section 6. The generated theme is an exact match to the runtime schema: all 66 required tokens, plus the optional `thinkingMax`, and nothing else.

  `~/.agents/skills/` needs no new work. omp treats it as its own canonical native skills location with its own `enableAgentsUser` toggle, so the five skills the pi block already links there arrive with nothing extra installed.

  One behavior to know: `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` has the highest precedence of any user-level context file in omp, so it shadows `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` in omp sessions rather than stacking with it. That is why the house preferences belong in it.

  `--verify` gains a row. `omp config get theme.dark` prints the effective value, so a pass proves omp read the file at that path and resolved the merged key. It reads the theme rather than a model role on purpose, because the theme resolves with no API key set and no provider reachable.

## [7.20.1] - 2026-09-08

A one-line correction to a number, found by running 7.20.0 rather than by reading it.

`--only macos-defaults,mac-bloat` reported `Installed: 29` on a run that installed nothing. The two `macos-defaults` segments announced their work through `success()`, which means "a tool was installed", so every system setting they applied landed in the wrong column. It is the defect #381 fixed, surviving in a section that fix did not reach.

Nothing was ever misapplied and `--dry-run` was never affected. Only the summary was wrong, which is the part of a run most people read.

### Fixed

- **`macos-defaults` reported configuration as installs** (#500). A run of `--only macos-defaults,mac-bloat` on 7.20.0 announced `Installed: 29, Configured: 0`. Nothing was installed. Twenty-nine things were configured, and the output said so in its own words: "Dock configured", "Screenshots configured", "Keyboard configured". Both segments reported through `success()`, which is defined as "a tool was INSTALLED" and counts into `INSTALL_SUCCESS`. They held 29 `success` calls and zero `configured` calls, which is exactly the number the run printed.

  This is the #381 defect in a section that fix did not reach. That issue split one counter into three precisely because "a run that installed nothing still reported 71", and the same shape survived here for every release since.

  Cosmetic rather than dangerous, in two respects. `--dry-run` was never affected: the segments carry 17 `DRY_RUN` guards and skip the work entirely, so a dry run always reported `Installed: 0` and the CI dry-run job stayed green throughout. No setting was ever misapplied either. The work was right and only the number describing it was wrong. What it cost is the thing #381 was about: the summary is the only part of a run most people read, and a number that counts configuration as installation cannot be used to spot a run that did not do its job.

  The comment above `configured()` is widened to match. It said "a config file was written", and a macOS default is a system setting rather than a file we own. The bucket is still correct, and a fourth counter would split a distinction nobody needs. One incidental gain: `configured()` is silent under `--dry-run` by design, so a line that a future edit moves outside its guard now stays quiet instead of claiming an action that did not happen.

## [7.20.0] - 2026-09-08

A release about this repo holding itself to the template it ships.

The `new-project` scaffold is generated from this script. This repo predates it, so nobody measured the two against each other until now. Doing that added `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, a `Justfile`, and the `specs/` tree. It also retired the rule in `CONVENTIONS.md` that rejected `specs/` by name. That rule was correct while nothing consumed the directory. It stopped being correct once bigpowers was adopted for work here.

The migration then found three defects in the scaffold itself, and all three are fixed here. The sharpest is that five of the seven `specs/` directories never reached a new project's first commit, because git does not track an empty directory. They existed for whoever ran the command and vanished on clone. That one affects every project scaffolded so far, not only future ones.

The release also makes Simplified Technical English a global rule for both agents. One generator writes it into `~/.claude/rules/writing.md` and into the tail of `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`, so Claude Code and pi follow provably identical rules. It replaces an opt-in skill that fired only when a prompt happened to match its description.

### Added

- **Simplified Technical English is now a global writing rule for both agents, from one generator** (#491). The `simple-english` skill has shipped with the pinned `bigpowers` package for a while, symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code and reachable by pi through its `packages` setting. In both agents it was **opt-in**: a skill fires only when the prompt matches its description, so it caught "de-slop this README" and missed every document written without those words. The 53 rules of ASD-STE100 Issue 9 now load on every session instead, as a new `~/.claude/rules/writing.md` alongside the existing eight rule files, and at the tail of `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`, which is pi's only global instruction file. The skill stays installed and is still the right tool for a formal audit of an existing document, because it carries a deterministic lint script this does not.

  The two copies come from **one** `emit_writing_rules` function rather than two heredocs. That is the whole design: the point of the change is that both agents follow provably identical rules, and a second heredoc would break that the first time one of them was edited alone. The generated block is verified byte-identical in both files.

  The rule has **two tiers**, because a single tier could not have been honest, and membership is by **document type rather than by whether the text lands in a file**. That distinction is the whole point: "written down" turned out to be the wrong axis. **Strict** covers commit messages, PR titles and bodies, specs, technical documentation, changelogs, release notes, incident reports, error messages and CLI output, UI copy, and instructions for AI agents. **Loose** covers issues and their comments, wikis, and chat, and means the mechanical subset only: no slop words, no filler adverbs, no Latin abbreviations, no hedging, one term per concept. The 20-word and 25-word limits and Rule 4.2 (no contractions) do not reach the loose tier.

  Issues and wikis are artifacts by any ordinary reading, and an earlier draft of this rule swept them into the strict tier for exactly that reason. They belong in the loose one. An issue is the first draft of a thought and usually a dialogue, so an imperative 20-word register makes people write less than the problem needs, and a bug report nobody bothered to file costs more than the slop in the one they did. A wiki is collaborative prose that many hands edit, and a rule every editor must relearn will not survive contact with them. Chat in a maintenance-manual register would contradict the "calm, technically sharp, and warm" voice that `rules/style.md` and the pi preferences both already ask for. Naming the boundary is what stops the two files from quietly fighting each other.

  This leaves a deliberate asymmetry inside a single workflow: **an issue body is loose and its PR body is strict**. The issue argues for a change while the shape of it is still open. The PR records what the change turned out to be, and that record is read later by someone who was not there.

  **One carve-out overrides the tier, and it is safety.** A warning about data loss, an irreversible action, or a destructive flag follows Section 7 wherever it appears, including inside a loose document: command or condition first, risk second. A tier controls register. Letting it control whether a reader is warned before they lose data would be the wrong trade at any register.

  The cost is roughly 3.5k tokens per session for each agent. For pi that is the larger trade, since its system prompt is otherwise under 1k by design, and it is accepted deliberately: an ungoverned local model produces exactly the slop the rules exist to remove.

- **This repo now follows the `new-project` template it generates** (#493). The scaffold at `scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh:9501-10283` postdates the repo, so the repo had never been held to it. Added the five things it was missing: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`, a `Justfile`, and the `specs/` tree. Most of the rest of the template was already met or exceeded here, so `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the community files were left alone.

  **`specs/` is the substantive part.** `CONVENTIONS.md` section 18 used to reject it by name, on the grounds that it would be "a single-source duplicate of this file". That was correct while nothing consumed it, and stopped being correct once bigpowers was adopted for work here: a skill that needs the active epic cannot get it from a normative rules document. Section 18 now states the boundary instead. This file holds standing rules, `specs/` holds state that changes as work progresses, and GitHub issues remain the system of record.

  Two files were populated rather than stubbed, because a stub would make `survey-context` report an empty project on a repo with 492 issues of history. `specs/tech-architecture/tech-stack.md` describes the five bands of the script, the helper layer that carries the risk, and the six known gaps. `specs/adr/` holds seven architecture decision records extracted from decisions `CONVENTIONS.md` already recorded as prose: the generator doctrine, the exact-match deletion test, deriving config paths from the tool, the hooks delegator chain, the double mise activation, the loud dispatch default, and macOS-only. The prose stays. An ADR answers why a rule exists, which is the question a reader has a year later. `CONVENTIONS.md` answers what the rule is, which is the question they have today.

  Two departures from the scaffold defaults, both deliberate. `specs/state.yaml` carries `workflow_mode: team-pr` rather than `solo-git`, because `release-branch` reads that key and this repo never commits to `main`. `.editorconfig` adds two rules the scaffold lacks: 4-space indentation for shell and bats, and no trailing-whitespace trimming under `scripts/`, which mirrors the exclusion `.pre-commit-config.yaml` already applies for heredocs that depend on exact bytes. Without the second, a formatter and a hook would disagree and produce a commit loop.

  Four template rules were **not** applied, because each is wrong for this repo rather than a gap in it. `feature_request.md` keeps `labels: feature`, which the scaffold warns against as a non-default label but which exists here. `SECURITY.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` keep a real contact address rather than the scaffold's GitHub-advisory fallback, which exists only because a scaffold cannot know one. The issue templates keep their macOS version, script version, and log path fields. And no tracked `CLAUDE.md` was added: the bigpowers `seed-conventions` skill wants it symlinked to `AGENTS.md`, while the scaffold and this machine's own doctrine both keep it private and gitignored.

  Adding `.gitattributes` caused no renormalization. `git ls-files --eol` reported every tracked text file as `i/lf w/lf` beforehand.

- **The `new-project` scaffold now documents `specs/adr/`** (#495). It created the directory and then never mentioned it again: the generated `CONVENTIONS.md` listed the specs convention without naming `adr/`, and the generated `AGENTS.md` listed `product/`, `tech-architecture/`, and the four status files, but not `adr/` either. Eleven bigpowers skills read that directory. A directory nothing documents stays empty, and the decisions that belong in it end up as prose scattered through `CONVENTIONS.md`, which is exactly what #493 had to unpick in this repo.

  The generated `CONVENTIONS.md` gains a `## Decisions` section stating the boundary that #493 arrived at: an ADR answers why a rule exists, and `CONVENTIONS.md` answers what the rule is, so both are kept and a change to one is a change to the other. `AGENTS.md` gains a line pointing at the directory, and `specs/README.md` is no longer a single sentence — it now carries the table of what each path holds and which skill writes it.

### Changed

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` was rewritten to point at `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` rather than restate them** (#493). It had drifted furthest of any file here. It carried its own copies of the branching rules, the conventional-commit rule, the helper-function rule, and the category rule, all of which are stated normatively elsewhere and none of which were in sync. It also omitted the two steps this repo treats as mandatory: open an issue before writing code, and update the changelog as part of the change. Both are now step 1 and step 4.

- **The verification loop is defined once, in the `Justfile`** (#493). It was written out three times, in `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md` section 19, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. `just preflight` runs lint, tests, the dry run, and the pre-commit hooks, and mirrors `.github/workflows/lint.yml`. The prose in each document stays, because each step proves something the others cannot, but the commands now live in one place. `just verify` is deliberately outside `preflight`: it queries the tools installed on the machine running it, so it cannot gate a pull request.

### Fixed

- **The rules inventory in `README.md` and `docs/GUIDE.md` was missing `style.md`** (#491). Both documents list the files written into `~/.claude/rules/`, and both stopped at `iac.md`, so the style rules had been generated and undocumented since they were added. Found while adding the `writing.md` row, and fixed in the same pass rather than shipping a table that was accurate about the new file and wrong about the old one. This is the drift `CONVENTIONS.md` warns about, in the exact place it warns about it.

- **Five of the seven `specs/` directories the scaffold creates never reached the first commit** (#496). `new-project` ran one `mkdir -p` for all seven, seeded files into `tech-architecture/` and `bugs/` only, then finished with `git add -A && git commit`. Git does not track an empty directory, so `product/snapshots/`, `epics/archive/`, `adr/`, `verifications/`, and `metrics/` existed for whoever ran the command and vanished on clone. Measured against the previous version: four directories reached the first commit, and now nine do.

  This is the quietest possible failure. The author sees the full tree locally and has no reason to look again, while everyone else gets a partial one and no error. It also compounded #495: `adr/` was both undocumented and absent, so nothing pointed at it and it was not there to find.

  Each of the five now carries a `README.md` naming what belongs in it and which skill fills it, rather than a `.gitkeep`. That follows the reasoning already written above `_spec_stub`: an empty tracked file tells a reader nothing, and a tool that guards on a path existing reads "present" as "done".

- **The scaffold's `.editorconfig` had no rule for shell** (#494). It set a 2-space default and carved out Makefile, Go, and Python, leaving shell on the default. That is the wrong way round on a machine whose own flagship project is 18k lines of 4-space bash, and every shell project scaffolded so far started out fighting the house style.

  It reached past taste, because the two editors this setup installs disagree about the file. croft does not read EditorConfig at all and defaults shell to 4 spaces. VS Code does read it. Without the rule the two reformat each other's work on every save; with it they agree.

## [7.19.0] - 2026-09-08

A documentation correctness pass, which started as a question about zellij. The multiplexer was hiding its own keybindings, because the generated config chose a layout that omits the plugin drawing them, leaving a modal tool running with no mode line. Pulling that thread found the same shape everywhere: documents asserting things nobody had checked. `SHORTCUTS.md` carried sections for two editors the setup does not install, and a macOS app table in which all four apps were deprecated, while the roughly thirty terminal apps that *are* installed shared a single entry between them. It is now 919 lines and 403 bindings, each traced to a named source. The generated Desktop `TOOL_REFERENCE.md` promised, twice, that every modern replacement was documented in full below; for nine of them, the tools aliased over `ls`, `cat`, `du`, `df`, `ps`, `top` and `watch`, no section existed at all. The Desktop keyboard card never admitted the full reference existed. All four are fixed, and every binding and flag was verified against the installed tool or its official documentation rather than written from memory, which caught several plausible-looking errors before they shipped.

### Changed

- **The Desktop keyboard card now points at the full shortcuts reference, and names zellij's mode keys** (#487). `docs/SHORTCUTS.md` grew to 400+ verified bindings in #482, but the 52-line Desktop card never mentioned it existed, so anyone reading it there had no way to know they were looking at the short version. The card stays a card, deliberately: its value is fitting on one screen. It now opens with a pointer saying what the full reference adds, including which tools have no fixed keymap because theirs is user-configurable. The multiplexer row also gains the six zellij **mode-entry** keys, cross-checked against `zellij setup --dump-config`. That is the one case worth inlining, because a modal tool is exactly where not knowing the entry key leaves you stuck with nothing on screen to recover from, which is also what #481 fixed from the other direction.

- **`SHORTCUTS.md` part 2: the remaining installed TUIs, with the honest answer where there is no published keymap** (#482, part 2 of 2). Deep tables now cover **micro** (24 bindings from upstream `runtime/help/defaultkeys.md`), **lnav** (roughly 70 keys across navigation, time travel, bookmarks, views and prompts, from docs.lnav.org), and **stu**. Two categories emerged that a naive sweep would have papered over. Three tools have **no fixed keymap to document at all** because their bindings are user-configurable: `trip` via `--tui-key-bindings`, `harlequin` via `--keymap-name`, and `clipse` via a `keyBindings` config map, each verified from the tool's own interface. For twenty more, the in-app help key genuinely *is* the documentation: `btop`'s 1,593-line README carries no keymap, atuin's documented keybinds page 404s, `fx` defers to a site that publishes no keybindings page, and the man pages for `w3m`, `bandwhich` and `atac` have no keybindings section. Rather than invent plausible tables, the file records what was checked for each, so this reads as a finding rather than a gap. Every installed tool with an interactive keymap now appears in the file in one of those three categories, and the counts are recomputed from its own tables.

- **`SHORTCUTS.md` now documents the terminal apps the setup actually installs, with every binding traced to a source** (#482, part 1 of 2). The file had drifted badly. It carried a `## Kiro Keybindings` section for an editor that sits in `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` and is actively uninstalled by `--cleanup`, and a `## Vim Keybindings` section for an editor the script installs zero copies of. The `macOS App Shortcuts` table was worse: **all four apps in it** (Slack, TablePlus, Snagit, Raycast) are deprecated and uninstalled, so the entire table documented software that is not on the machine. Meanwhile the ~30 TUIs that *are* installed had exactly one entry between them, `fzf`. Deep tables now cover **zellij, lazygit, k9s, lazydocker, broot, jqp, jnv, mpv, newsboat, and wiper**, plus the in-app help key for `e1s` and `lazysql`, and the two genuine Ghostty global hotkeys replace the dead app table. Every section names where its bindings came from, because that is what makes a wrong row traceable rather than mysterious: `zellij setup --dump-config` (84 bindings across seven modes), `lazygit --config` (its full 178-entry keybinding tree), `man mpv`, this repo's own generated newsboat config, and the official upstream docs for the rest. The same sweep caught two smaller drifts: the Claude Code command table was missing the three `/probe-*` commands added in #464, and every count in the summary table was wrong. Counts are now derived from the file's own tables. A second PR covers the remaining ~24 tools, which are listed explicitly under Coverage rather than quietly omitted.

### Fixed

- **`TOOL_REFERENCE.md` no longer promises nine sections that do not exist** (#486). The generated Desktop reference opens with a "Modern replacements" table and states, twice, that each entry is "documented in full in its section below". For nine of them it was not: `bat`, `eza`, `dust`, `duf`, `procs`, `btop`, `zoxide`, `sd`, and `viddy` appeared only in the table row and the pointer sentence itself, one to three occurrences each in a 135 KB file. The omission read as accidental rather than deliberate, because six tools from the same table did have sections. These are also the tools aliased over `ls`, `cat`, `du`, `df`, `ps`, `top`, and `watch`, so they are the most-typed commands on the machine. All nine now have full sections in the house format, and the fix was to write them rather than soften the claim. Every flag was verified against the installed binary before it was written down, which caught three would-be errors: `duf` takes **single-dash** Go-style flags (`-only`, `-hide`, `-json`), `sd` has `-F/--fixed-strings` and not `--string-mode`, and `btop`'s help is ANSI-escaped so a naive grep reports it as having no flags at all. Every example command was then executed to confirm it runs. The `dust` and `procs` sections carry the alias hazard `AGENTS.md` already documents: `du -sh` prints dust's help rather than a size, and `ps aux` silently ignores its argument.

- **Zellij was hiding its own keybindings, because the generated config chose a layout without the plugin that draws them** (#481). `default_layout` was set to `"compact"`, and `zellij setup --dump-layout` shows the difference is not cosmetic: the `default` layout is `tab-bar` + panes + `status-bar`, while `compact` is panes + `compact-bar`. `status-bar` is the plugin that renders the per-mode keybinding hints, so "compact" did not shrink the hints, it removed them. That matters more for zellij than for most tools, because it is modal (`Ctrl+p` pane, `Ctrl+t` tab, `Ctrl+n` resize, `Ctrl+s` scroll, `Ctrl+o` session, `Ctrl+h` move, `Ctrl+g` lock), and a modal UI with no visible mode line is undiscoverable. The layout is now `"default"`, and `show_startup_tips` and `mouse_hover_tips` are both on. Separately, `layouts/dev.kdl` declared only its two panes: a custom layout replaces the default one wholesale, so the `dev` layout had no bar at all, and it now declares `tab-bar` and `status-bar` explicitly using the exact syntax `zellij setup --dump-layout default` emits. The success line claiming a "compact layout" was corrected too.

## [7.18.0] - 2026-09-08

This release is a correctness pass over the things that describe other things. `CHANGELOG.md` becomes navigable: every version heading now resolves to a compare view, which is the one Keep a Changelog principle the file had never implemented, and the agent docs stop prescribing a reference convention the repo abandoned fifteen releases ago. The `new-project` scaffold stops asserting facts it does not have, so a deliberately language-neutral template no longer hardcodes `pnpm`, six planning files no longer ship at zero bytes reading as "done" to anything that checks existence, and the project type finally does something beyond picking a parent directory, which means an open source repo now ships with a real LICENSE. New repos also inherit the changelog conventions and issue templates rather than a stub of each. Alongside that, `git cleanup` learns to delete merged branches that never had an upstream, and new Claude Code sessions name themselves `<date>-<repo>` so the `/resume` picker is scannable.

### Added

- **New Claude Code sessions are now auto-named `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<repo>`** (#478). Left to itself every session is untitled, so `/resume` is a wall of identical rows and the name has to be typed by hand with `/rename`. Claude Code 2.1.220 has a first-class `-n/--name` flag for exactly this, so it needs no hook, only a shell wrapper to fill it in. The repo half comes from the **git remote** rather than the directory: this checkout is `vixygrey-dev-setup-main` on disk but `vixygrey-dev-setup` on GitHub, and the remote name is what the project is actually called. It falls back to the repo root directory, then to `$PWD`, and handles SSH remotes, HTTPS remotes with and without a `.git` suffix, and a trailing slash. The date is zero-padded on purpose, because `2026-9-8` does not sort lexically and an unpadded `/resume` list would order 10 September before 9 September. The wrapper deliberately does **not** inject a name when the session is being resumed (`-r`, `--resume`, `-c`, `--continue`, `--from-pr`), since stamping today's date over a session started last week would be wrong, nor when an explicit `-n`/`--name` was passed. It lives inside the interactive-only guard, so agents and scripts that invoke `claude` are unaffected, and calls through `command claude` so it cannot recurse.

- **`new-project oss` now scaffolds a LICENSE, and the project type finally does something** (#474). The type argument was a four-arm `case` whose entire effect was choosing a parent directory; nothing downstream read it again. So a repo explicitly declared open source shipped with no `LICENSE`, which leaves it under exclusive copyright by default, the opposite of the intent, and with no `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` either. `oss` now gets all four. The license is **MIT by default** with a `--license <spdx>` override, taking the year from the clock and the holder from `git config user.name`; `new-project` stays non-interactive. MIT, ISC, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, and Unlicense are bundled, and anything else **fails loudly before the project directory is created** rather than writing a stub, because a placeholder LICENSE looks like a license to a scanner and grants nothing. `--license` on a non-oss project says it is being ignored instead of silently discarding it. `SECURITY.md` routes reports through GitHub's private advisory flow rather than an email address the scaffold cannot know, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` points at `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` instead of restating them. The `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` enforcement contact is the one deliberate placeholder, marked with a comment saying why it has to be filled in. The other three project types are byte-identical to before, verified by diffing their output against the previous version.

- **New repos now scaffold issue templates, not just a PR template** (#473). Both scaffolded agent docs push issue-first hard, `AGENTS.md` going as far as listing "do not write code before the issue exists" under Hard stops, and the scaffold backed the second half of that sequence with `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and the first half with nothing. New repos now get `bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md` following the same Problem / Proposed fix / Verification shape, plus a `config.yml` that deliberately leaves blank issues enabled so a one-line issue does not have to go through a form. The templates reference only GitHub's **default** labels: a fresh repo has `bug` and `enhancement` but not `feature`, so naming `feature` would have tagged every new issue with a label that does not exist in the repo it was just filed in. `/init-project` was updated alongside, since it describes the template independently of the code that writes it.

### Changed

- **New repos scaffolded by `new-project` now start with the same changelog conventions this repo just adopted** (#468). The template already wrote a `CHANGELOG.md`, but it was a stub: no format or SemVer declaration, only `### Added` of the six groups, nothing about linkable versions, and no reference convention. It now declares Keep a Changelog and Semantic Versioning, lists all six groups, states that entries cite the issue number, and explains that a bare `#N` in a Markdown file does not autolink on GitHub, which is why the version heading has to carry the link. The scaffolded `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` previously said nothing about the changelog at all, so an agent in a new repo had no instruction to touch it; they now carry the process and the format rules respectively, split the same way this repo splits them. `/init-project` was updated in the same pass, because it describes the template independently of the code that writes it and would otherwise keep advertising the old stub. One thing is deliberately **not** scaffolded: the compare-link definitions themselves. `new-project` runs `git init` with no remote and no tags, so there is no URL to point at and no tag to compare against; emitting `OWNER/REPO` placeholders would give every new repo a block of dead links. The instruction ships instead, as an inert fenced example, verified to render as code rather than as live link definitions.

- **`CHANGELOG.md` is now linkable, and the agent docs describe the reference convention the repo actually uses** (#466). Every version heading now resolves to a GitHub compare view through link reference definitions at the bottom of the file, which is the one Keep a Changelog principle this file had never implemented. It matters more than it looks: a bare `#N` inside a Markdown file does **not** autolink on GitHub, because autolinking needs a repository context that conversations and commit messages supply and file rendering does not. So until now a reader of this file had no clickable path to anything, neither the release diff nor the issue. The header also states the SemVer policy and warns that entries cite issues while the release page lists PRs, so the mismatch between the two views stops reading as a mistake. Alongside it, `AGENTS.md` stops telling contributors to reference the PR number: the repo moved to issue references around 7.2.0 and never updated the rule, and the `(#193)` in its own example is a PR from the era when the rule was still accurate. `Security` joins the documented group list for future entries; nothing already published was reclassified, because those headings have shipped and been read.

### Fixed

- **The `new-project` scaffold asserted a runtime it had deliberately not chosen, and wrote six empty files** (#472). #458 refused to write a `package.json` so the scaffold would not imply Node, but the prose assumed Node anyway: `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` hardcoded `pnpm install` / `dev` / `test` / `build`, and the `.gitignore` was Node-only. A Python or Go repo was wrong from its first minute, and passing `--justfile` made it self-contradictory, since the generated `Justfile` offered `just dev` while the two docs beside it still said `pnpm`. Both command surfaces now derive from the flag: real `just` commands when it is passed, honest `TODO` placeholders when it is not. The `.gitignore` keeps a language-neutral core and moves the ecosystem-specific rules into labelled blocks a project can delete as a unit, with Python and Go/Rust blocks added. Separately, all six Markdown files under `specs/tech-architecture/` were created with `touch` and shipped at 0 bytes. That tells a reader nothing, and worse, a tool guarding on `[ -f … ]` reads "present" as "done", so the skill that exists to write the file skips it. Each now carries a heading and a one-line brief naming what belongs there and which skill fills it, matching what the YAML placeholders in the same scaffold already did. Also fixed: `.env*` was silently ignoring `.env.example`, the one env file most projects want committed.

- **`git cleanup` could never delete a merged branch that had no upstream** (#470). The alias selected purely on an upstream marked `[gone]`, which is what a squash merge plus `--delete-branch` leaves behind and is the common case here. A branch that never had an upstream at all cannot carry that marker, so anything created locally and never pushed, or pushed without `-u`, was permanently invisible to it no matter how thoroughly merged. Found while tidying up after #469, where the alias force-deleted the branch with an unmerged commit and ignored the one that was fully merged and completely safe. Both doc surfaces had been promising the missing half the whole time: `docs/GUIDE.md` said "delete branches merged into main", and the generated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` told agents to "use `git cleanup` to prune merged branches". Selection is now the union of the two tests, deduplicated, with the default branch read from `origin/HEAD` instead of hardcoded and excluded from its own merged list. This is deliberately **not** a revert of #321: ancestry alone was that bug, because a squash merge writes a new commit the branch tip is not an ancestor of, so `--merged` sees none of them. Ancestry is added as a second selector, not swapped in as the only one, and the delete stays `-D` with a printed `git branch <name> <sha>` restore line, since `-d` applies the same ancestry test that squash-merged branches fail. The implementation moved from `gone` to `cleanup`, which is the honest name once the behavior is "gone or merged"; `gone` remains as a second name for the one implementation.

## [7.17.0] - 2026-09-08

This release is about identity and coherence. Pi returns as a fully generator-owned second agent, with local models, a house theme, curated skills, a SearXNG-backed research path, and bigpowers provisioned through the delivery path each of the two agents actually uses. Tiki becomes a real notebook surface rather than an empty git repo. The Dracula-Sakura palette finishes its sweep across the terminal, prompt, editors, bar, and the remaining TUIs, and the docs now distinguish the tools that use the house palette from the ones still on a stock Dracula variant. Alongside that, nine workflow and data tools join the machine with generator-owned config where it earns one, `new-project` scaffolds a Bigpowers-aligned repo with an optional starter Justfile, `CONVENTIONS.md` splits the normative code-shape rules out of `AGENTS.md`, and the CI and release path gain `actionlint`, a published SHA256, tighter branch protection, and a single audited remote-installer helper.

### Added

- **`CONVENTIONS.md`** (#395). The repo's documentation is now split along a line the codebase already implicitly followed but had not made explicit: `AGENTS.md` stays the procedural / workflow doc for AI coding agents (issue-first rule, generator-vs-output doctrine, verification loop, release prep), and `CONVENTIONS.md` becomes the normative / code-shape doc — helper usage, managed-block discipline, category structure, dependency policy, test architecture. Both files are tracked. When they conflict, follow AGENTS.md's process and CONVENTIONS.md's substance.

- **The setup now adds four high-leverage workflow/data tools — `PyYAML`, `actionlint`, `duckdb`, and `jc`** (#434). `actionlint` joins the local toolchain and CI as the GitHub Actions-specific linter that YAML parsing alone cannot replace, `duckdb` adds a real local analytics database alongside the existing SQL/data stack, and `jc` makes classic command output easier to pipe into `jq` and automation. `PyYAML` is delivered deliberately as an isolated `uv`-managed helper interpreter (`yaml-py`) rather than as a global site-package mutation, so local YAML one-liners/scripts gain `import yaml` without polluting the main Python runtime. README and the generated Desktop tool reference were updated alongside the installs; none of the four exposes a meaningful theming surface, so this lands as install+docs rather than a new config block.

- **Five more terminal surfaces now join the machine with generator-owned config where it matters** (#435). `mprocs`, `jqp`, `broot`, `aichat`, and `kondo` are added to the install set, but not as bare packages: `mprocs` gets a global process-runner config, `jqp` a Dracula-Sakura-flavored YAML config, `broot` a shell-integrated `br` launcher plus a custom skin, and `aichat` a local-Ollama-backed config with a Dracula-Sakura dark theme and document loaders wired to tools the machine already has. `kondo` deliberately stays install-only apart from docs, because its real surface is the prompt-driven cleanup action rather than a useful persistent config file.

- **Pi is back as a generator-owned second agent, with local models, theme, and curated skills rather than a bare install** (#436). The setup now reinstalls `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` with the upstream `--ignore-scripts` recommendation, writes `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, `models.json`, and a custom `themes/dracula-sakura.json`, and recreates the curated five-skill bridge through `~/.agents/skills/`. The local Ollama inventory is expanded to include the machine's current chat/coding models (`qwen2.5-coder:14b`, `llama3.1:8b`, `gemma3:4b`, `llama3.2:latest`) alongside the existing embedding model for herald/aichat. One omission is deliberate and documented in code and docs rather than silent: `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` stays pulled on the machine but is **not** exposed as a Pi chat model, because Pi's custom-model surface is for agent/chat models, not embeddings. Also deliberate for now: this restores the install/theme/settings/models/skills layer only — not the earlier Pi safety extensions or third-party Pi packages.

### Changed

- **Claude Code now gets a trimmed Socratic probe trio rather than a sprawling boilerplate command pack** (#463). The generated command set now adds `/probe-assumptions`, `/probe-evidence`, and `/probe-implications` for pressure testing documents, plans, and proposals. Each command stays compact and uses the same output shape: bottom line, key findings, quoted evidence, open risks, and what to validate next.

- **The new project template now states its writing conventions for repo workflow artifacts more explicitly** (#461). Scaffolded `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` now require conventional commits and conventional pull request titles, keep issues direct and low on narrative overhead, and say that commit, PR, and issue prose should stay first person, clear, accurate, and softly aligned with the Dracula Sakura house style when there is room for voice.

- **The new project template now states its Git process more explicitly** (#459). Scaffolded `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` now say the quiet part out loud: trunk based development is the default, branches should stay short lived, and the expected sequence for non trivial work is issue first, then branch, then code, then PR. That was already the user's real workflow; the template now encodes it instead of leaving it implicit.

- **`new-project` stays language neutral by default, but can now add an optional starter `Justfile`** (#458). The new Bigpowers-aligned scaffold deliberately does not invent a `package.json` for non-Node projects, but `new-project --justfile` now writes a small honest command spine with placeholder `dev`, `test`, `build`, `lint`, and `preflight` recipes for repos that want one.

- **`new-project` and `/init-project` now point at a fuller Bigpowers-aligned repo scaffold** (#456). New repositories now start with a public `AGENTS.md`, a normative `CONVENTIONS.md`, a `specs/` cockpit with the core YAML state files and architecture/product placeholders Bigpowers expects, plus explicit LF line-ending enforcement through both `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes`. The older light scaffold was fine for generic repos, but it did not encode the actual planning and documentation shape this machine now wants by default.

- **The global Claude and Pi instruction layers now speak in a tighter Dracula-Sakura house voice and carry stronger durable-context rules** (#454). The generated global `CLAUDE.md` now adds explicit output preferences (no em dashes, less hyphen heavy phrasing), anti-trope writing guidance, durable preference and stable-vs-volatile context rules, two-attempt error recovery, warning intolerance, and compact token discipline. Pi's global `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` is now generator-owned too, so the same house voice and context hygiene land reproducibly on other machines rather than living only on the maintainer's box.

- **`bigpowers` is now provisioned again for both Pi and Claude Code CLI, and via the right delivery paths** (#452). The setup now installs the pinned npm package `bigpowers@2.88.1`, merges `npm:bigpowers@2.88.1` into Pi's `packages` array so Pi loads its package-manifest resources on both fresh and already-provisioned machines, and asks bigpowers' own installer helper to link its managed skills/hooks into `~/.claude/`. This keeps Pi package loading and Claude skill linking separate instead of pretending one install surface serves both.

- **Pi now gets a local SearXNG-backed web-research path from the generator, not just file/bash tools** (#450). The setup now writes a Pi extension at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/searxng-web.ts` that exposes `searxng_search`, `searxng_fetch`, and a small `/searxng-check` command, plus a matching `searxng-web` skill under `~/.pi/agent/skills/`. The design stays local-first and dependency-light: search goes through the user's own SearXNG instance, page fetches reject private/local targets other than that configured host, and the fetch side does a fuller readable-text extraction than a bare tag strip so actual page reads are more usable in-agent.

- **Pi now gets a fuller Tiki skill set on every machine, not just the shared CRUD bridge** (#448). The setup already linked the shared `tiki` skill into `~/.agents/skills/`; it now also writes five Pi-local companion skills under `~/.pi/agent/skills/` — `tiki-capture`, `tiki-review`, `tiki-groom`, `tiki-arc`, and `tiki-journal` — so quick capture, reviews, notebook cleanup, larger arc management, and reflective journaling are reproducible rather than hand-added. The shared `tiki` skill text was also tightened locally toward Pi-friendly guidance: JSON-first queries, workflow-label caution, softer note-taking examples, and less software-only framing.

- **The generated Tiki notebook scaffold now includes a matching root `README.md`** (#446). The notebook already had a themed `index.md` for Tiki's wiki view; it now also gets a plain-repo entry page so Finder previews, editors, terminal listings, and GitHub all open on the same soft Dracula-Sakura explanation of the layout, views, and common `tiki` flows. The post-setup guidance and tool reference were updated to mention the README alongside the landing page and starter folders.

- **The setup now scaffolds Tiki as a real notebook surface, not just an empty repo** (#444). `~/Documents/notes` still lands git-initialized, but it now also gets a managed `index.md` landing page plus a small folder constellation — `inbox`, `journal`, `ideas`, `life-admin`, `projects`, `reference`, `archive` — so the wiki opens onto something welcoming and the notebook has a gentle default shape from the first run. The generated docs were updated alongside it so the post-setup guidance and tool reference point at the seeded layout rather than an unspecified empty directory.

- **The generated Tiki workflow now leans more fully into the house Dracula-Sakura voice, with a softer anime/feminine accent layer** (#442). The workflow keeps its underlying machine-stable status values and trigger behavior, but renames the visible surface toward a gentler presentation: `Ready` becomes `Petals`, `Flow` becomes `Starlight`, roadmap/project/document wording shifts toward `Constellation`, `Arc`, and `Atelier`, and action / field labels now read more like a themed notebook than a bare kanban board. Default tags also begin with `sakura`, so fresh notes arrive already carrying the house motif.

- **`CONVENTIONS.md` §17 is now grounded in the codebase, not folklore.** A review of each future-considerations item against the current script turned up one item that was already done (the lazygit `--verify` row landed in #387), one whose premise was wrong (the cross-platform path helper bullet assumed a multi-platform repo, but §16 is macOS-only), and several whose wording overstated the gap (the pre-commit hook's claimed Ruby coverage, the shell-startup coverage framing as k9s/nushell-specific). The §17 list now removes the stale items, reframes the partial items with concrete code references, and adds an explicit "§17 itself drifts" item that mandates shrinking the list as items land as real PRs.

- **Ghostty and Starship now share a softer Dracula-Sakura palette** (#402). The terminal itself and the prompt were already themed, but each still leaned on stock Dracula defaults in slightly different ways. The generator now keeps the existing layouts and behavior while aligning both surfaces on the same rose / lilac / cyan / mint accent mapping used by the house theme: Ghostty gets a Sakura-tinted 16-color palette plus the softer selection color, and Starship's two-line prompt keeps its structure while shifting semantic roles toward the shared palette (rose for primary emphasis, lilac for secondary focus, cyan for info, mint for healthy states, peach for warnings, red for destructive ones).

- **The generated Claude Code guidance now carries a compact Dracula-Sakura style layer** (#404). The global `CLAUDE.md` gains a short communication-and-style section, and the generated rules now include `style.md`, so the machine's Claude environment encodes the same calm, polished, technically sharp voice as the rest of the setup without muddying the workflow, security, or tooling rules. The additions stay brief on purpose: they clarify tone, UI/theming preferences, and recommendation style, while keeping the operational guidance practical.

- **VS Code's generated defaults now add a subtle Dracula-Sakura accent layer** (#406). The base theme remains `Dracula Theme`, but the generator now overlays workbench accents, token-color emphasis, and integrated-terminal ANSI colors that align with the house palette: rose and blush for primary emphasis, lilac for borders and secondary focus, cyan for informative highlights, mint for healthy/function-like code, yellow for strings, and the softer Sakura selection purple across lists and editor selections. Formatter, language, and merge-path behavior are unchanged; this is a palette refinement, not an editor-policy rewrite.

- **SketchyBar's generated config now uses the fuller Dracula-Sakura palette and softer chrome** (#408). The bar keeps its current widget layout and plugin structure, but moves from flatter stock-Dracula cards toward panel-based chrome with lilac borders, muted text, and clearer semantic accents: blush and rose for the left-side focal items, cyan for connectivity and capture affordances, mint for healthy states, peach for load and warning-adjacent status, and lilac for memory / secondary emphasis. The Shottr popup is restyled to match, and the plugin outputs are updated to use the same shared palette.

- **lazygit, k9s, and gh-dash now share a tighter Dracula-Sakura accent mapping** (#410). `lazygit` keeps its current layout and workflow but softens inactive and default surfaces toward the panel/muted palette, `k9s` swaps the remaining stock Dracula hexes in its generated skin for the house colors, and `gh-dash` expands its minimal theme block so text and border roles align with the same lilac / rose / cyan / mint / peach hierarchy as the rest of the machine.

- **The remaining Dracula-configured TUI surfaces now align more closely with the house palette** (#412). `btop` switches to a Sakura-tinted custom theme, `lazydocker` adopts the same rose / lilac / cyan / muted hierarchy as the other TUIs, `trippy` replaces its stock-Dracula values with the shared palette, and `newsboat`'s color roles move toward the softer lilac / rose / cyan accent mix while keeping its current feed list and keybindings intact.

- **Docs and generated summaries now tell the same Dracula-Sakura story as the machine** (#414). README, GUIDE, and the generated post-run / Desktop summaries were updated to distinguish the tools that now use the shared Dracula-Sakura house palette from the ones that still use a built-in Dracula variant. The same sweep turned up one small functional mismatch during local QA: `btop.conf` had been switched to `color_theme = "dracula-sakura"` while the generator still wrote `themes/dracula.theme`. The theme file now lands at `themes/dracula-sakura.theme`, with the old managed filename cleaned up conservatively on re-run.

- **The Dracula-Sakura wallpaper is now bundled and installed into `~/Media/photos`** (#416). The setup already created the media tree on every machine; this change makes the wallpaper asset itself reproducible too by shipping `assets/wallpapers/dracula-sakura.jpg`, copying it to `~/Media/photos/dracula-sakura.jpg` during the filesystem pass, and including the asset in the release zip so the distributed script does not reference a missing file. The setup deliberately does **not** auto-apply the wallpaper — it installs the file only.

- **The generated onboarding/docs layer now points people at the bundled wallpaper and speaks in a more consistent house voice** (#418, #419). `POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` now calls out the exact wallpaper path and says plainly that setup installs the file but leaves application to the user. The Desktop docs (`KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md`, `TOOLKIT_SUMMARY.md`, `TOOL_REFERENCE.md`) also got a light tone pass: the opening paragraphs are a little warmer and more cohesive, but still compact and practical. Claude Code's generated statusline moved with them — still minimal, now using the Dracula-Sakura accent mapping and a cleaner bullet-separated model / directory / branch display.

- **fzf, the quick-terminal launcher, and the first shell greeting now feel more like one surface** (#421, #422). The managed `.zshrc` now gives `fzf` the house accent mapping more consistently — rose prompt, lilac border/pointer, mint marker, cyan match highlight — and adds a compact control hint in the header instead of leaving the interaction implicit. The launcher functions keep their command names and behavior, but the prompts and helper text are clearer (`apps`, `files`, `matches`, plus short action hints) and the generated docs describe them in the same voice. `fastfetch` also got a gentle presentation pass: a Sakura-tinted palette, cleaner key labels/icons, and a slightly softer title line, while the shell greeting stays concise and now adds one muted quick-flow line (`a`, `ff`, `rgf`, `zellij --layout dev`) after the timestamp.

- **The setup script's own presentation layer is now a little more cohesive** (#420). The splash line, a few section banners, and the completion summary headings were tightened so the script itself matches the calmer Dracula-Sakura tone the generated machine now uses: still terse, still practical, just a touch more polished in the places people actually see every run.

- **Main branch protection now requires the checks that actually prove this repo is healthy** (#424). The ruleset no longer gates merges on `ShellCheck` alone; it now also requires the helper bats suite, Homebrew canonical-name audit, generated-config parsing job, and the real macOS dry run. That brings the merge gate into line with the defect classes the repo has already paid to encode in CI.

- **Release builds now publish a SHA256 alongside the macOS zip** (#427). The release workflow still ships the same archive, but now also writes `vixygrey-dev-setup-macos-vX.Y.Z.zip.sha256` and uploads it as a second asset, so consumers can verify the bootstrap artifact before running it.

- **GitHub Actions are now linted with `actionlint` locally and in CI** (#434). The tool is installed by the setup script like the rest of the workflow toolchain, `lint.yml` now runs an `Actionlint` job, and the tracked branch-protection ruleset names that check too so the repo's desired merge gate stays aligned with the CI surface it actually depends on.

- **The bootstrap trust boundary is now documented where people actually start** (#429). README and the guide now call out that first-run setup fetches Homebrew, rustup, and pnpm installers from upstream and that those payloads are not checksum-pinned by this repo today. The note stays short and practical: inspect first if you want, use `--dry-run`, and prefer tagged release artifacts with the published SHA256.

- **The remote-installer flows now go through one helper with an optional checksum hook** (#430). Homebrew, rustup, and pnpm no longer each hand-roll their own download / empty-file / execute path. A new `run_remote_installer` helper centralizes the fetch-and-exec boundary, logs whether a flow is pinned or unpinned, supports passing installer args cleanly, and accepts an optional SHA256 for the day a path is ready to pin. Behavior today is intentionally unchanged unless a checksum is provided; the win is that the trust boundary is now one small helper instead of three drifting copies.
### Fixed

- **`write_generated()` dry runs now report creates as well as refreshes** (#426). The managed-block helpers already learned to say `Would create` on a fresh machine and `Would refresh` on an existing one, but `write_generated()` still stayed silent when its target file was absent. That made clean-machine previews understate the work for generated outputs like Claude subagents, slash commands, and other non-marker-managed files. The helper now mirrors `write_managed()`'s dry-run narration: absent file → `Would create`, existing changed file → `Would refresh`, identical file → silence. Covered by helper tests for both branches.

- **Claude Code's default auto-approval surface is narrower and more honest about risk** (#425). The generated settings still auto-approve read-heavy local inspection, linting, formatting, and the small git subset this setup depends on, but they no longer silently bless package installs, remote-model calls, trust-store mutation, or generic web fetches. Fresh installs drop `Bash(npm install *)`, `Bash(llm *)`, `Bash(mkcert *)`, and `WebFetch` from the allowlist, and the existing-machine merge path now strips those exact entries too — which matters because this branch's `jq` subtraction is exact, not pattern-based. README's Claude section was updated with the same framing so the docs stop describing `npm install`, `llm`, `mkcert`, and `WebFetch` as part of the safe baseline.

- **`--verify` now asks two more tools whether they are actually reading the config we write** (#428). `harlequin` and `stern` were moved out of the permanently-hand-wavy bucket by parsing their own help text for the default config path they advertise. This cuts the truly unverified surface further without pretending every TUI has a real validator.

- **`--cleanup` could not remove npm-installed tools — the entry format had no way to name one** (#399). `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` dispatched on four types (`formula`/`brew`, `cask`, `mas`) and nothing else, so a package installed with `npm_global_install` was unreachable: not merely unhandled by the `case`, but inexpressible as a row in the first place. The script installs 20 packages that way, and **three have already been dropped from it over its history** — `playwright` and `storybook` (removed in #24/#42) and an npm-installed `repomix` (#34) — each of which stayed behind on every machine that had it. `repomix` is the sharp illustration: it has had a `brew:` row since #34, but that row only ever removed a Homebrew copy and never touched an npm one.

  A new `npm` arm uninstalls with `npm uninstall -g`, gated on a directory probe against `npm root -g` rather than `npm ls -g <name>` — `npm ls` is a slow spawn per row and exits non-zero for reasons unrelated to presence (peer-dep warnings), which would quietly turn a real removal into a skip. The root is resolved once before the loop instead of per entry, and is empty when npm is absent, which makes every npm row a skip rather than an error. `--dry-run` narrates and changes nothing.

  Following §14, `npm` is a **single canonical key with no alias** — the `brew`/`formula` pair is precisely what #242 had to clean up — so a misspelling like `pnpm:` still lands on the loud `*)` default instead of silently doing nothing.

  **`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` is deliberately not listed.** pi was dropped from the script in #360, but installing it by hand afterwards is a reasonable thing to do and at least one machine has done exactly that. A row for it would make every subsequent `--cleanup` silently uninstall a tool the user chose to bring back. The omission is commented in place so it does not read as an oversight.

  Covered by a new `tests/cleanup-npm.bats` (7 cases). These run the real `--cleanup` block end to end rather than a copy of it — the block is self-contained and exits ahead of both `preflight` and `acquire_lock`, so it needs no lock — against stubbed `npm`/`brew`/`mas` in a temp `$HOME`, which also keeps them hermetic and fast (a real `brew list` per row is ~1s × 98 rows). The `npm` stub records invocations, so *"a dry run does not uninstall"* is an assertion rather than an inference. **Verified by mutation:** with the new arm deleted, 5 of the 7 fail. The first draft of the suite passed against that same mutant — every assertion was matching the display name, which the loud default also prints — so the assertions now pin the exact `Would remove: …` line and additionally assert the absence of an `unknown entry type 'npm'` warning, which is what distinguishes "the arm ran and found nothing" from "no arm matched".

## [7.16.0] - 2026-09-07

This release hardens the setup script end to end: CI now runs it on macOS, generated-config and helper coverage are much broader, dry-run is honest and non-mutating, and several long-lived config-path and tooling defects are fixed alongside the rollback of the pi experiment.

### Added

- **CI now runs the script** (#376, #378). Both existing jobs are `ubuntu-latest`, and this script is macOS + Homebrew + zsh only — so for the whole of 7.x, nothing in CI had ever *executed* it. What CI proved was that the file is valid bash, passes ShellCheck, and that 22 of its heredocs parse. What it could not prove was that the thing runs.

  `bash -n` checks grammar, not reachability. It cannot see a misspelled function name on a branch nobody took, a `case` arm that matches nothing, a category missing from `ALL_CATEGORIES`, or a flag parsed into the wrong variable. That class has already reached a real machine: the local error logs carry `Unknown option: --only core` three separate times. A new `macos-latest` job runs `--dry-run --no-prompt`, which exercises argument parsing, preflight, category dispatch, every `should_run` gate, all 96 `write_managed` calls in dry-run mode, and the summary.

  **It found something on its first run**, which is the argument for the job in one line. The script requires bash 4+ and refuses to start without it; macOS ships 3.2 and the runner image has no Homebrew bash, so CI hit the exact message a user on a clean Mac gets — and that requirement turns out to be written down nowhere but the script's own guard. README's *Prerequisites (auto-installed)* table lists the seven things the script installs for you and omits the one thing it does not (#379). The job installs bash the way a real user would, which also means it exercises the re-exec path rather than skipping it.

  **And then it found a second thing.** With bash in place the script ran end to end on a clean machine for the first time, and reported `Failed: 1` — `gh extension install dlvhdr/gh-dash`, attempted for real during a `--dry-run`. It is a raw block rather than one of the managed helpers, so it had to guard itself and did not; on an already-provisioned machine the extension is present and the branch is never taken, which is why it survived. Guarded here. It turns out not to be alone — a dry run also runs the remote pnpm installer, makes 53 `git config --global` writes and a `brew bundle dump`, all under a run that signs off with *"no changes were made"* (#380). That is why this job asserts only that the script **runs and exits 0**, not yet that a dry run leaves no trace; the stronger assertion belongs with the fix.

  The job carries a second step that pins **#370** rather than trusting it: a green dry run proves a *clean* run exits 0 and says nothing about a run **with** failures, which is the half that was broken and the half the job's own value depends on. So it injects one synthetic `error` immediately before the summary and asserts the status comes back non-zero — with a `grep -qx` on the anchor first, so a moved marker fails loudly instead of quietly testing an unmodified copy. That is the same silent-no-op guard the `generated-config` job applies to an empty heredoc extraction.

### Changed

- **The summary separates what was installed from what was configured** (#381, #383). `success()` had been doing three jobs — a tool installed, a config file written, a preflight check passed — and counting all three into one `Installed:` number. On a fully provisioned machine a run that installed *nothing* still reported `Installed: 71`: 65 config writes and 6 preflight checks wearing an install's clothes.

  Now `Installed:` counts installs, a new **`Configured:`** line counts config writes, and preflight checks are printed green but counted nowhere — "Disk space: 291GB free" was never an install. It also sharpens the #258 caveat numerically: `--only git` reports `Configured: 0` rather than folding its zero configuration work into a healthy-looking number.

- **`generated-config` CI now parses 31 more generated heredocs** (#373). The job's `tag|validator` table went from 22 rows to 53. The new rows cover the highest-blast-radius omissions: `ZSHENV_CONF` / `ZPROFILE_CONF` (every shell, agents included), every `HOOK_*` (every `git commit`), every `P_*` and the three `SBAR_*` (SketchyBar's silent-per-plugin failure mode), `STATUSLINE` and `SCRIPT` (`~/Scripts/bin/*`), `DOCKER_CONF`, `FASTFETCH_CONF`, `K9S_CFG`, `GEM_CONF`, and `GHOSTTY_PLIST_EOF` (validated with `python3 -c 'import plistlib'` rather than `plutil`, so the row runs on Linux too). Every row was extracted and validated against current `main` before the PR opened, so the job cannot turn CI red on merge — it only prevents the next regression.

- **`--verify` covers materially more of the 96 managed files and stops understating the gap** (#374). Eight new `path` rows: `git`, `ssh`, `npm`, `pip`, `gem`, `direnv`, `gh`, and `ripgrep` — each asks the tool itself where it reads from, with tilde-normalisation on both sides so tools that return absolute paths and tools that return `~/...` match. The summary now also prints `Files not verified: 67 (of 96)` — the true count of managed files `--verify` never visits — alongside the per-row `Unverified` line, which counts only `unchecked` rows. Both numbers replace the implicit suggestion that the row table covers the whole surface.

- **The helper layer can now be loaded and unit-tested in isolation** (#375). `SETUP_LIB_ONLY=1 source scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh` returns after every helper is defined and before `preflight` runs, so a bats suite on `ubuntu-latest` can exercise `write_managed`, `remove_superseded_managed`, `_trim_blank_edges`, and `_has_content` in throwaway temp dirs with **no macOS, no Homebrew and no network**. A new `Helper unit tests` job in `lint.yml` runs `bats tests/` on every PR; the suite starts with the four helpers above (the ones AGENTS.md named by hand over five postmortems) and grows from there. Loading under the guard creates zero files under `$HOME`; a normal dry run is unchanged.

- **Every declared Homebrew name is now checked against Homebrew's core API** (#384). A new `Homebrew name canonicality` job in `lint.yml` parses `https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.json` and `cask.json` (cached by UTC date, restored with `actions/cache`) and asserts that every `brew_install "X"` and `brew_cask_install "X"` declaration names a canonical, current formula/cask of the right type. It catches aliases and `oldname`/`old_token`s (#371: `kubectl` is an alias of `kubernetes-cli`), wrong-type declarations (#366: `tflint`/`keyward` were declared formulae when they are casks), and a bare name that is not in core and not declared with its tap — which is indistinguishable from a typo. The 17 tap packages formerly declared with bare names have been normalised to `user/repo/name`, the same shape `oven-sh/bun/bun` and `neilotoole/sq/sq` already used, so each declaration now says where its package comes from and the check has no exceptions to remember.

### Fixed

- **`--dry-run` no longer poisons later runs or writes bat / k9s config through unguarded side paths** (#390, #391, #392). `mark_done()` is now a no-op under `--dry-run`, so a preview no longer seeds `~/.local/share/dev-setup/completed-items.txt` with work that never happened and then lets `--resume` skip it later. Two remaining direct-write config branches were fixed too: `bat`'s built-in Dracula theme line and syntax-mapping block now go through dry-run-aware append helpers, and the existing-file `k9s` branch no longer appends a bare `  skin: dracula` line to EOF. Existing `k9s` YAML is updated with `yq` when available; otherwise the script warns and leaves the file alone rather than risking a malformed append.

- **The bash bootstrap now tells the truth about prerequisites and finds more installed shells** (#379). README and `docs/GUIDE.md` now warn up front that macOS ships `bash` 3.2 while the script needs 4+. The startup guard no longer probes only `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` and `/usr/local/bin/bash`; it now also checks `bash` on `PATH`, `$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash`, and MacPorts' `/opt/local/bin/bash`, and verifies a candidate is actually bash 4+ before `exec`ing it. That lets a machine with a perfectly good newer bash outside the two hardcoded paths start successfully, and avoids looping into another 3.2.

- **`--dry-run` reported 65 completed actions it had not performed** (#381, #383). `delta configured as git pager`, `k9s Dracula skin configured`, `Global git hooks created`, and 62 more — every one printed by a `success` call that fired unconditionally around a `write_managed` that had correctly done nothing.

  The messages are past-tense summaries, so they are now **silent** under `--dry-run` rather than reworded: no prefix makes "delta configured as git pager" honest about something that did not happen.

  Nothing is lost from the preview because the same change fixes the opposite problem. `write_managed` used to announce a file only when it already existed *and* differed — so on a **fresh machine, where all 96 files are absent and every one of them would be created, a dry run named none of them.** The preview was least informative exactly where it matters most. It now says `Would create` / `Would refresh` per file: **102 lines on a clean machine**, and 34 refreshes + 2 creates on this one, which is a real answer to "what would a run touch".

  This is the other half of #380. That one stopped the dry run changing anything; this one stops it claiming it did. CI asserts both — the job already failed if a dry run left a trace, and now also fails if it reports a non-zero `Installed:` or `Configured:`. Verified by re-breaking the guard and watching it report `Configured: 65`, the exact count from the bug.

- **`--dry-run` was changing the machine** (#380, #382). It signs off with *"This was a dry run — no changes were made."* That was not true. On a clean machine a preview ran the remote pnpm installer (`curl … get.pnpm.io/install.sh` → `bash "$installer"`), made **53 `git config --global` writes** — pager, aliases, `core.hooksPath`, `core.excludesfile`, the commit template, the `includeIf` identity routing — ran `brew update` and `brew bundle dump`, `docker buildx install`, `mkcert -install`, `chmod 700 ~/.gnupg` plus a `gpgconf --kill`, and created `~/.hushlogin`, `~/.fzf.zsh`, `~/.docker` and a handful of config directories.

  **`mkcert -install` is the one worth naming twice**: it writes a root CA into the system trust store, which is close to the last thing a preview should do to a machine you are still deciding about. It also never appeared in CI, because a dry run does not install mkcert and the block sits behind `installed mkcert` — a whole class that only fires on a machine that already has the tool, and therefore only ever on a real user's.

  None of it was visible on an already-provisioned machine, where every one of those writes is a no-op. That is why it survived: the only place it shows is a machine nobody had run it against, which is exactly the machine whose owner is most entitled to trust the flag.

  Two helpers rather than 60 inline guards, because guarding each site works once and rots at the next addition: **`git_global`** wraps every `git config --global` **write** (reads stay raw — routing a read through a dry-run guard would make it return success without answering the question, which is how a guard becomes a bug), and **`ensure_dir`** wraps the `mkdir -p` calls a dry run reaches. The rest — pnpm, `brew update`, the Brewfile dump, buildx, mkcert, GPG, `.hushlogin`, `.fzf.zsh` — got explicit guards.

  **`k9s info` was the last one, and it is the interesting one.** Nothing of ours created `~/.config/k9s/skins`; k9s creates its own config directory *as a side effect of being asked where its config lives* — verified against a throwaway `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, where `k9s info` alone leaves both directories behind. So the "ask the tool, do not hardcode" rule this repo adopted in #333 can itself be a mutation. It still holds for a real run; under `--dry-run` the documented default is used instead, and the preview may name the wrong path on a relocated k9s. A preview may be approximate. It may not change anything.

  Found by the macOS CI job from #376 on its first end-to-end run, then chased down by running a dry run against a throwaway `$HOME` and listing what appeared — which is now the check itself: the job asserts a dry run leaves nothing behind but its own log directory. Proven in both directions, by re-breaking two guards and watching it go red. A denylist of paths we write, deliberately not "the directory must be empty" — merely invoking brew, npm and `code` populates their caches, and an emptiness check would fail on the next tool that caches something and train everyone to skim past it.

  What a dry run still gets wrong is its *output*: it reports 68 completed actions it did not perform, and `Installed:` counts them. That is #381.

### Removed

- **The GitLens VS Code extension is gone** (#362), and `gitkraken-cli` is installed in its place. This list described it for a long time as *"GitLens (blame, history, authorship)"* — three things `lazygit`, `delta`, `difft` and `git-cliff` already do, in the terminal, which is where the work actually happens. GitLens 19 is a far larger freemium product than that line admits: Launchpad, Cloud Patches, Code Suggest, cloud workspaces, AI commit messages, most of it either Pro-gated or a second copy of a CLI installed a few hundred lines above it. 34 MB across two extension directories and an account nag, on the editor that is explicitly the *escape hatch* rather than the daily driver. That is precisely the opposite of the rule written at the top of the extension list — **every entry mirrors a CLI this script already installs** — and it had been sitting there failing that test.

  **It was not a clean removal, and that is the part worth keeping.** GitLens had quietly registered the `GitKraken` MCP server into `~/.claude.json` itself, pointing at a 19 MB `gk` binary it had downloaded into its own VS Code `globalStorage`. So **31 Claude Code tools** — the `git_*` porcelain, `pull_request_*`, `issues_*`, `gitlens_launchpad` — depended on a path inside an extension that **no step in this generator owned**, and `code --uninstall-extension` would have deleted it and taken all 31 with it, silently, with nothing in this repo to explain where they went. A generated machine had grown a load-bearing dependency on something it did not generate.

  Done as two ordered steps so nothing broke in between: `gitkraken-cli` installed first (Homebrew cask, ships `gk` as a Binary artifact), the MCP server re-pointed at it and **verified `✔ Connected`**, and only then the extension removed. Parity was checked rather than assumed — the standalone `gk mcp` serves the same 31 tools by name, and `pull_request_assigned_to_me` returned byte-identical output from both binaries before the swap, because both read the same auth store (`~/.local/share/gk`, `~/Library/Application Support/gk`) rather than anything extension-scoped.

  The server is now registered from the `add_mcp` block like every other one, so it is idempotent, survives a re-run, and is documented. It also gained `--no-telemetry`, which suppresses gk's OTel spans and Sentry reporting — consistent with the `"telemetry.telemetryLevel": "off"` this script already writes into VS Code's settings.

  The one feature with no CLI equivalent is the **inline blame annotation on the current line** — `git blame` in another pane is not the same thing as seeing it in peripheral vision. If it turns out to be missed, `waderyan.gitblame` is ~200 KB for that single behaviour. Nothing else about GitLens was in use.

- **The `gitkraken-hooks` Claude Code plugin went with it** — uninstalled, and the `gitkraken` marketplace deregistered. It billed itself as *"live AI session tracking for GitKraken products"*: its entire purpose was streaming this session to a **GitLens / GitKraken Desktop UI that is no longer installed**, so it had become a pure outbound feed with nothing at the other end.

  Reading the manifest before removing it is what made the decision obvious. It registered **22 hook events**, not the handful the one-line description implies — `UserPromptSubmit` (every prompt typed), `InstructionsLoaded` (the CLAUDE.md contents), `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `SubagentStart`, `Elicitation`, `PreCompact` — each shelling out to `gk ai hook run`, and **two of them `--blocking`**, meaning a subprocess sat in the critical path of every tool call. `~/.claude.json` had recorded 405 invocations across the two plugin ids.

  This is not managed by the generator — Claude Code plugins are live state under `~/.claude/`, and this script has never written `enabledPlugins`. Removed with `claude plugin uninstall` and `claude plugin marketplace remove` rather than by hand-editing `settings.json`; `enabledPlugins` and `extraKnownMarketplaces` are now empty and `claude plugin list` reports none. Noted here because it arrived *with* GitLens, silently, and would otherwise have outlived it with no record of where it came from.

- **pi is gone** — from the generator and from the machine. It was added, configured and hardened over the course of a day, tried in practice, and did not earn its place. Three reasons, all upstream and none with a fix in sight:

  - **It loads no context files at all.** Not a project `AGENTS.md`, not `CLAUDE.md`, not its own documented global `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`. Hierarchical `AGENTS.md` support was a main reason for adopting it. Confirmed with a formatting directive even a small model obeys, and with input-token counts identical in a bare directory and in a repo carrying an 8,159-token `AGENTS.md`.
  - **Local models cannot drive its agent loop.** `gpt-oss:20b` passes every raw endpoint probe — structured `tool_calls`, with and without a system prompt — and makes **zero** tool calls through pi in every configuration tried, then reports success it did not achieve. `qwen3:8b` manages one tool call and fails a read-then-write sequence.
  - **Neither remote auth path is satisfactory.** Anthropic bills third-party harness usage as extra usage per token rather than against the Max plan; a session comparable to one day's work here measured **~$202** at Opus 5 rates. GitHub Copilot auth works but goes through `api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`, an undocumented endpoint, while GitHub's own SDK exists as the sanctioned path and pi does not use it.

  Removed with it: the pi install and its two pinned packages, the whole `~/.pi/agent` config block (settings, models, Dracula theme, five safety extensions, generated `protected-paths`), the five shared skills in `~/.agents/skills/`, the `validate|pi` row in `--verify`, the CLAUDE.md guidance, and `qwen3:8b` from `OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODELS` (18 GB of pi-only models removed from the machine alongside `gpt-oss:20b`).

  **`bigpowers` deliberately survives.** It was installed inside pi's package tree, and the working Claude Code MCP server resolves its entry point from there. It is now a normal global install, and `bigpowers-mcp-shim` finds it through its existing fallback candidate — verified still `✔ Connected` after pi was removed. The 81 project-local skills in `.claude/skills/` are plain files and were never affected.

### Changed

- **`--verify` now checks three configs it used to shrug at** (#367). `starship`, `topgrade` and `git-cliff` were labelled *"no validator and no way to ask"*. They all have a way to ask; it just is not the obvious one. Verified count goes 10 → 13, unverified 10 → 7.

  This matters because #366's topgrade bug lived in that bucket: its config had been rejected on every single run, and `--verify` reported it as merely unverifiable rather than broken. The new row fails on exactly that file — confirmed by restoring the original and watching it go red.

  **Two of the three lie in their exit code, and the naive check silently inverts.** `topgrade --dry-run` exits 1 even on a perfectly good config, and `starship print-config` exits 0 even on one it could not parse. Written inline as `! topgrade --dry-run | grep -q 'Failed to deserialize'`, `set -o pipefail` makes the pipeline return topgrade's 1, the `!` flips it to 0, and the row reports **OK for a config topgrade had just rejected**. That false pass was caught only by deliberately re-breaking the config and re-running — a check that cannot fail is worse than no check, because the summary counts it as verified. Both now go through `_verify_*` helpers that capture output and then judge it, the pattern `_verify_asciinema` already established for the same reason.

  `git-cliff` is handed its path explicitly rather than left to resolve one: it legitimately prefers a `./cliff.toml`, so a `path` row would pass or fail depending on which directory `--verify` was run from.

  The remaining seven — `trippy`, `harlequin`, `gh-dash`, `stern`, `lazydocker`, `yt-dlp`, `micro` — stay honestly labelled. None can report the config path they would resolve, and their config is only exercised by launching a TUI. `stern --config` and `micro -config-dir` accept a path but will not report the default they would otherwise use, which is the thing that needs verifying.

- **repo**: `PI_SHIM_EXCLUDE` renamed to `SHIM_EXCLUDE`. The prefix suggested it had something to do with pi; it is the Python-family exclusion list for the `~/.local/bin` shim links and always was.

- **docs**: The pi-specific rules are out of AGENTS.md. The general lessons found *through* pi stay, because they are about this repo rather than about pi — shell startup order and `~/.zshenv` precedence, `~/.local/bin` outranking Homebrew, uninstall-before-install when two packages own one bin path, `{ umask; }` leaking where `( umask; )` does not, and the self-healing bug that hides from every check made after the fact.


### Fixed

- **The script always exited 0, even when items failed** (#370, #377). `set +e` is deliberate — one bad formula must not abandon the other two hundred — but nothing ever converted the counted failures back into an exit status, and the last statement in the file was a bare `echo`. So a run could print `Failed: 12` and still satisfy `./setup-dev-tools-mac.sh && echo ok`.

  The reason it survived this long is that the only failure signal was the macOS notification, and `notify_failure` opens with `command -v terminal-notifier >/dev/null || return 0`. Interactively there is a banner and a red summary; in a launchd job, a `topgrade` step, an `&&` chain or a CI runner there was **nothing at all** — a run with a dozen failures was byte-identical, to its caller, to a clean one.

  Now `exit 1` when `INSTALL_FAILED > 0`. `--dry-run` is included on purpose: it counts errors too, and a preview that cannot fail is no use as a gate. The interactive `exec zsh -l` prompt still replaces the process and takes the status with it, which is acceptable rather than worth contorting the flow for — `exec` is only reached when a human answered the prompt having just read the red summary, and `--no-prompt` answers `n` (#265), so every unattended run reaches the exit. Proven by injecting one synthetic `error` before the summary: `Failed: 1` → exit 1; a clean dry run still exits 0.

- **`kubectl` is a Homebrew alias, and was declared as one** (#371). The canonical formula is `kubernetes-cli`, which is what `brew list --formula -1` prints — and that list is what `_brew_has_formula` matches against. So the membership test was false on a machine that already had kubectl installed, every non-resume run took the install branch, `brew install kubectl` no-opped, and the run recorded a fresh install that never happened. `--dry-run` claimed it was missing on a fully provisioned machine.

  Exactly the shape of the `tflint`/`keyward` cask-as-formula bug below, one layer along: the name was not wrong, it was not *canonical*. Checked across all 174 declared formulae by diffing the declarations against `brew list --formula -1`; `kubectl` was the only one. (`tlrc` also showed up in that diff and is simply not installed on this machine yet — not an alias problem.)

- **`--dry-run` reported every VS Code extension as pending, on a machine that had them all** (#372). `vscode_ext_install` checked `DRY_RUN` before consulting the cached extension list, so it printed 26 `Would install VS Code extension: …` lines for 26 extensions that were already installed, and counted none of them as skipped.

  The early check was deliberate and its reasoning holds for the case it was written for: on a fresh machine the cask that provides `code` is installed a few lines above, so guarding on `code` first made a fresh-machine dry run refuse to preview a single extension — useless exactly where a preview matters most. The bug was that the *same* branch was taken on a machine where `code` exists and can answer the question. Now it asks when it can and falls back to the unconditional preview when it cannot, the way the brew helpers already resolve already-installed inside their own dry-run branch. `Skipped:` on this machine goes 253 → 280 (26 extensions plus kubectl).

- **Two more generated configs had never been used by the tool they were written for** (#366). Found by sweeping for more of the #364 class — config that is generated, assumed working, and never actually exercised.

  **topgrade rejected its config on every run.** `cleanup = true` sat at the top level, where it is not a valid key; it belongs under `[misc]`. topgrade refuses the *whole file* on a single unknown field, so every invocation died at `Failed to deserialize ~/.config/topgrade.toml: unknown field 'cleanup'` before doing any work. The path was always right — the schema was not.

  A trap worth recording, because it nearly produced a false "verified": **`topgrade --config <file>` is not a faithful validator of the default config.** A file passed that way is deserialized as an *include section*, which tolerates unknown fields — the broken config passes cleanly through `--config` and fails through `~/.config/topgrade.toml`. Only `topgrade --dry-run` against the default path reproduces the error, and that is what #367 wires into `--verify`.

  **harlequin never read its config at all.** The script wrote `~/.config/harlequin/config.toml`; harlequin's own `--help` says it "finds files named `.harlequin.toml` in the current directory and the home directory (~) and merges them". `HARLEQUIN_CONFIG_PATH` was set nowhere — not in the script, not in `~/.zshrc`, not in the environment — so the Dracula theme and vscode keymap applied to nothing. The content was always valid; only the location was wrong. Now written to `~/.harlequin.toml`, with `remove_superseded_managed` clearing the old path, exactly as lazygit's identical bug was handled in #333.

- **`tflint` and `keyward` are casks, and were being installed as formulae** (#366). `brew install` falls back to the cask so both installed correctly, but `_brew_has_formula` can never match a cask: every non-resume run re-ran `brew install` for two already-installed tools, reported them as freshly installed, and `--dry-run` always claimed they were missing. Moved to `brew_cask_install`.

  Nothing else was wrong. The sweep that found these checked 174 formulae (none deprecated or disabled), 26 casks, 20 npm packages, 7 PyPI packages (none yanked), 26 VS Code extension IDs, all 14 MCP servers, and every `installed` guard in the script.

- **`aws-knowledge` was registered with the wrong transport and had never once connected** (#364). It was added as `uvx awslabs.aws-knowledge-mcp-server@latest`, but the AWS Knowledge MCP Server is a **remote, fully managed HTTP endpoint** — `https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws`, no authentication, no AWS account, rate-limited. It is the only non-stdio server in this setup, and there is no legitimate PyPI distribution to `uvx` at all.

  The name that *was* on PyPI — `awslabs.aws-knowledge-mcp-server`, a single 0.1.0 uploaded 2025-10-15, declaring `github.com/awslabs/aws-knowledge-mcp-server` as its homepage — is **yanked, with the reason `Not ours`**. It was not published by AWS Labs. So this line had been pointing `uvx` at a squatted package name.

  **Nothing was fetched or executed here.** `~/.cache/uv` has no trace of it: uv refuses a yanked-only resolution rather than falling back to it, so the server failed closed from the moment it was added. The bug that made this visible is the same property that made it harmless — which is luck, not design, and worth saying plainly.

  It also sat as a red `✘ Failed to connect` line in `--verify` output long enough to read as background noise, which is the #327 lesson repeating: routine noise trains you to skim past real failures. It looked like a flaky `uvx` install for as long as nobody ran the command by hand.

- **core**: **Shim links are created after the installs, not before.** #353 linked mise shims into `~/.local/bin` from a block in `core` at line ~2105, while the `npm_global_install` calls start at ~2292. A tool installed during a run therefore got its mise shim and **no `~/.local/bin` link until the next run** — so `pi`, `claude`, `prettier` and `copilot` were unreachable from git hooks, launchd and GUI-launched editors for one full run after being installed.

  It **self-healed on the next run**, which is exactly why it survived: every tool that looked correctly linked had been installed by an *earlier* run than the one that linked it, and a login shell finds everything through mise activation regardless. Testing the obvious way says it works. Installing the Copilot CLI (#356) is what exposed it — `copilot` resolved in a login shell and not in a bare `sh`.

  The root cause was two jobs with opposite timing requirements sharing one block: putting mise's node on the run's own `PATH` (#343) must happen **early**, before any `npm_global_install`, or `installed npm` is false for the rest of the run; linking shims into `~/.local/bin` (#353) must happen **late**, after every install, or it cannot see what was just installed. The `PATH` fix stays in `core`; the linking moves to the end of the run.

  It is deliberately **outside every `should_run` guard**, not parked in `configs`: `--only dx` installs tools, so `--only dx` must link them — a category guard would reintroduce the same gap for anyone running a single category. Re-linking is idempotent, so running it on every invocation costs nothing.

  Verified against the exact failure: `copilot` removed completely (package, shim and link), then a single `--only dx` run both installed it and reported `37 mise shims linked`, after which `copilot --version` answers under `env -i` with only `HOME` and a minimal `PATH`.

### Added

- **dx**: **GitHub Copilot CLI is now managed** — `@github/copilot`, installed via npm. It is a **standalone package now**, not a `gh` extension; the `--uninstall` notes still pointed at `gh extension remove github/gh-copilot`, which has been reworded to name that as the *retired* path and add the npm uninstall for the current CLI. Installing it through `npm_global_install` keeps it in the single npm tree (#343) and gives it a mise shim, so #353 makes `copilot` reachable from git hooks and GUI-launched editors rather than zsh alone.

  **`@github/copilot` is proprietary** (`"license": "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE.md"`) — a deliberate exception to the open-source preference, recorded here rather than left to slip in unremarked.

### Fixed

- **dx**: **The Copilot VS Code extensions are deliberately NOT installed**, which is the opposite of what this change originally set out to do. Current VS Code ships Copilot **built in** — 1.136.1 carries `copilot-chat` 0.64.1 inside the app bundle (`Contents/Resources/app/extensions/copilot`). `code --install-extension github.copilot` pulls `github.copilot-chat` as a dependency and then fails:

  ```
  Extension 'github.copilot-chat' is a built-in extension with version '0.64.1'
  and cannot be downgraded to version '0.48.1'.
  ```

  Adding those two lines to the managed extension list would have bought nothing and printed a red `Failed` on **every run** — routine noise that trains you to skim past real failures, which is the #327 lesson. Sign in to the bundled extension; nothing needs installing. The reasoning is recorded in place so the next person does not re-add them.

### Notes

- **pi can authenticate with a GitHub Copilot subscription.** Confirmed in pi's own `docs/providers.md`: GitHub Copilot sits alongside ChatGPT Plus/Pro and Claude Pro/Max as a subscription provider. `pi` then `/login`, choose GitHub Copilot, press Enter for github.com.

  This matters for the cost finding in #349 — pi on Anthropic auth bills as **extra usage per token**, not against the Max plan; routing it through Copilot avoids that billing path. One documented gotcha: if pi reports **"model not supported"**, enable the model in VS Code first (Copilot Chat -> model selector -> select model -> *Enable*). Whether Copilot's terms permit third-party harness use, and how its quotas behave under an agent loop, are open questions worth answering before relying on it.

### Changed

- **core**: **Every mise-managed tool is now reachable outside zsh, not just `node`/`npm`/`npx`.** #345 linked those three shims into `~/.local/bin`; the same gap still applied to the other 48 — `pi`, `claude`, `prettier`, `tsc`, `tsx`, the `ni` family, and the language servers — all of which were only on `PATH` where `mise activate` had run, which means zsh.

  It surfaced as `pi: command not found` in a shell opened before pi moved into mise's tree. New shells resolved it; git hooks, launchd jobs and GUI-launched editors did not.

  **Linked by exclusion, not by allowlist**, so a tool added to mise later is picked up automatically instead of silently missing until someone notices — that silent-gap shape is the reason this block exists at all. 36 shims link; the rest are held back on purpose.

  **The Python family and `corepack` are deliberately excluded.** `~/.local/bin` sits at `PATH` position 9 against `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin` at 13, so anything linked there wins in *every* context. `pre-commit` builds its hook environments against whichever `python3` it finds, and retargeting that machine-wide to mise's 3.12 would break envs already built against Homebrew's — #345 again, one language over. `corepack` manages package-manager shims and collides with the pnpm setup. Verified after the change: `python3` in a bare `sh` still resolves to `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`.

  Dangling links are pruned, because a tool removed from mise otherwise leaves a link that resolves to nothing and reports "command not found" only at the point of use. The prune only ever removes a **symlink pointing into the mise shims directory** — a real file placed in `~/.local/bin` by hand (`soffice`, `office-py`, `manly`, `starlit`) is untouched, and so is a symlink pointing anywhere else. Both cases tested.

### Added

- **configs**: **pi's two third-party packages are now installed by the script, pinned** — `pi-web-access@0.28.0` and `bigpowers@2.88.1`. Both had been installed by hand, so a rebuild silently lost them.

  - **`pi-web-access`** — pi ships **no** web tool at all: no search, no fetch. This is the largest functional gap versus Claude Code, and it is invisible until you ask pi something that needs a doc page. Note its queries go to Exa by default (#349).
  - **`bigpowers`** — 81 software-engineering skills behind a single `bigpowers_skill` tool.

  **Pinned deliberately.** Unlike the bundled safety extensions, these are third-party, and pi loads them in-process, unsandboxed, with full user permissions — `bigpowers` ships an extension, and global extensions load with no trust prompt. A pin means a broken or compromised upstream release cannot arrive silently on the next run. Bumps are manual: that is the trade, not neglect.

  Both were reviewed before adoption — MIT, real repos, **no `preinstall`/`postinstall`/`prepare` hooks**, no telemetry; `bigpowers`' extension makes no network calls and its only `execSync` is a fixed `git rev-parse` with no interpolation.

  Guarded on the `packages` array in `settings.json` rather than re-running `pi install`, which succeeds every time but hits npm on every setup run.

  **Correcting the reasoning behind the five-skill curation:** `bigpowers` costs **+0 system-prompt tokens**, measured (2050 before, 2050 after). pi normally injects every discovered skill's name and description into the system prompt — which is exactly why only five Claude skills are shared — but a package that registers a *tool* instead injects nothing. The per-skill budget does not apply to it, and an estimate that assumed otherwise was off by ~6,000 tokens.

### Added

- **configs**: **Five safety extensions wired into pi.** pi has four tools, one of them is `bash`, there is no built-in confirmation step, and its own security doc says plainly *"It is not a sandbox."* These are pi's **own** bundled examples, copied from the installed package — first-party, so they add no supply-chain surface:

  | Extension | What it does |
  |---|---|
  | `permission-gate.ts` | Confirms before dangerous bash (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, …) — the guardrail Claude Code has by default and pi does not |
  | `protected-paths.ts` | Blocks write/edit to credential and VCS-internal paths |
  | `git-checkpoint.ts` | Git stash checkpoint each turn, so `/fork` restores code state, not just the conversation |
  | `dirty-repo-guard.ts` | Blocks session changes when the repo has uncommitted work |
  | `notify.ts` | Native terminal notification when pi is waiting for input |

  That distinction matters, because pi extensions run **in-process, unsandboxed, with your full permissions**, and *global* extensions load with no trust prompt at all — project trust only gates `.pi/` resources. Treat `pi install npm:<anything>` as the same decision as `npm i -g`.

  `protected-paths.ts` is **generated**, not copied. Upstream's example hardcodes `[".env", ".git/", "node_modules/"]`, which says nothing about credentials; ours extends it to `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (a live OAuth token), `~/.claude/`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.netrc`, `gh/hosts.yml` and `Library/Keychains/` — the "never touch credentials" rule enforced by the harness rather than hoped for.

  One trap worth recording: the event field is **`event.toolName`**, not `event.tool`. The first draft of the generated extension used `event.tool`, which matches nothing — it would have loaded cleanly, reported success, and blocked precisely nothing. Verified functionally instead of by eye: pi was asked to write a `.env` and was refused, with zero files created.

### Added

- **dx**: **`pi` — a second coding agent alongside Claude Code.** Four tools (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash`), a system prompt under 1,000 tokens, and no sub-agents, todo list, plan mode or **MCP support** — upstream considers MCP token-wasteful and prefers CLI tools with READMEs. It is a complement, not a replacement: anything that needs an MCP server (herald, `gws`, GitHub, AWS) stays Claude Code's job, because pi cannot reach those servers at all.

  **The package namespace is the first trap.** Every blog post and write-up points at `badlogic/pi-mono` -> `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, which stopped at 0.73.1 in May 2026. The live project is `earendil-works/pi` -> `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Installing the one the articles name gets a months-stale fork that still appears to work — the same silent-wrong-thing shape this repo keeps finding.

  `npm_global_install` now forwards extra flags to `npm install -g`, because pi documents `--ignore-scripts` as part of its install form and a package that needs it is not served by a helper that cannot express it.

- **configs**: **pi configuration under `~/.pi/agent/`** — `settings.json` (Dracula, `micro` as external editor, telemetry and analytics off, Anthropic as default provider), `models.json` (registers the local Ollama provider), and a full `themes/dracula.json`. Both JSON files are `jq`-merged rather than overwritten, so hand-added providers and settings survive a re-run.

  **pi ignores `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` completely.** Settings, providers, themes, sessions and credentials all live under `~/.pi/agent`, so `~/.config/pi` would have been #338's "valid config, wrong address" all over again. Credentials stay out of scope: `pi` then `/login` writes `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` at 0600, and the script never reads, writes or echoes it — the same line already drawn at `llm keys set anthropic`.

  The Dracula theme defines all 51 schema-required colour tokens plus the 3 optional ones. pi's bundled theme schema sets `additionalProperties: false`, so a typo'd token name is rejected outright rather than silently ignored; validate against the schema in the installed package after any edit.

- **configs**: **five skills shared with Claude Code** via per-skill symlinks in `~/.agents/skills/` — `api-testing`, `d2-diagrams`, `dbmate-migrations`, `office-docs`, `tiki`. Deliberately not the whole of `~/.claude/skills/`: pi injects **every** discovered skill's name and description into its system prompt at startup (`/skill:name` is only a manual override), and that prompt is under 1k tokens by design. All 29 skills measure roughly 1,000 tokens of frontmatter on their own, which would about double it — mostly with Google Workspace recipes a coding agent will never call. These five cost ~392 tokens.

  Per-skill links rather than a directory symlink for a second reason: the `gws` skills are re-copied from upstream on every run, so their frontmatter cannot be edited to carry `disable-model-invocation` — the next run would overwrite it. Stale links this script made are pruned on re-run, and only ever if they are symlinks pointing into `~/.claude/skills` — a real directory you put there is untouched.

- **cli**: **`--verify` now covers pi**, as a `validate`-grade row. `pi --list-models` knows the `ollama` provider *only* because our generated `models.json` defines it, so a hit proves pi found our file at its own default address — the path question and the format question answered in one shot, which is the strongest form the check offers.

- **mac-productivity**: **`qwen3:8b` added to the default Ollama model set** (~5.2 GB), so pi has a local model that can actually drive an agent loop. `gemma3:4b` is a chat model and cannot.

  The obvious-looking pick, `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, is worse than useless here: it advertises `tools` in `ollama show` and then returns the call as literal text in the message content with `tool_calls: null` — on the native `/api/chat` endpoint as well as the OpenAI-compatible one, so it is the model, not the shim. Verified against `llama3.2` as a control, which returns a proper structured call. Re-run that `curl` check before ever swapping this model.

### Fixed

- **core**: **One Node, owned by mise.** `npm` resolved to two different global prefixes depending on how the shell was started, leaving this machine with two global `node_modules` trees, **18 packages present in both**, and `npm install -g` writing to whichever tree the invoking shell happened to pick.

  The source was `brew_install "prettier"`: the Homebrew formula **depends on `node`**, so it silently installed Node 26.8.1 next to the `node@lts` (24.18.1) this script pins through mise. prettier now installs from **npm** instead, and an existing-machine migration removes the Homebrew copy and lets `brew autoremove` take its orphaned Node with it. prettier was the only formula holding that Node (`brew uses --installed node`), and nothing in the script referenced its path.

  Nothing about this ever errored. `mise current node` kept reporting the pinned 24.18.1, `_npm_has` truthfully answered "already installed" about a tree `PATH` never reached, and every run finished `Failed: 0` — the same silent-wrong-address family as #329/#332/#333, one layer down.

- **core**: **Node, npm and npx are reachable again outside a mise-activated shell.** #344 removed Homebrew's node for good reasons, and in doing so took `node`/`npm`/`npx` off nearly every `PATH` on the machine: `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin` is on the `PATH` of `sh`, of git hooks, and of most GUI-launched processes, while a mise-managed tool is only on the `PATH` of a shell that ran `mise activate` — which means zsh, and only zsh. It surfaced as a prettier pre-commit hook in an unrelated repo failing with `npx not found`.

  Worse than failing, in one place: the generated Claude format-on-edit hook guards its call with `command -v npx` and falls back to `command -v prettier`. Both guards missed, so it silently formatted nothing, with no error, in every non-mise-activated context.

  mise ships **shims** for exactly this — they resolve the active version with no shell activation at all. The shims directory cannot go on a system-wide `PATH` without `sudo`, but `~/.local/bin` is already on `PATH` in that environment and this script already uses it that way (`soffice`, `office-py`, `manly`, `starlit`), so `node`, `npm` and `npx` are now linked into it.

  Verified against a real git hook run under `env -i` with nothing but `HOME` and a minimal `PATH`: `npx 11.16.0, node v24.18.1`. Two constraints found by testing rather than reading — the link name must match the shim name (mise dispatches on `argv[0]`; a link named anything else fails with `is not a valid shim`), and the link must point at the **shim**, not at the versioned `installs/node/<ver>/bin` path, which silently rots at the next `mise use node@…`.

- **core**: **The script now puts the Node it just installed on its own `PATH`.** `mise activate bash` registers a `PROMPT_COMMAND` hook, and `PROMPT_COMMAND` never fires in a non-interactive script — so the run's own `PATH` never picked up the `node@lts` mise had just installed. Whenever the invoking shell did not already have mise's Node in front, `installed npm` was false for the remainder of the run and **every** `npm_global_install` — pi, Claude Code, prettier, commitizen, commitlint, ni — silently no-opped while the run still reported `Failed: 0`.

  This was reproduced live: with Homebrew's node removed, a `--only code-quality` run found no `npm` at all and skipped prettier without a word. `mise which node` resolves the real binary without needing the hook, so the run now prepends it explicitly.

- **shell**: **mise now gets the last word on `PATH`.** zsh reads `~/.zshenv` -> `~/.zprofile` -> `~/.zshrc`, so activating mise in `~/.zshenv` — correct for coverage, since it is the only file every shell type reads — guaranteed it was activated *first*, and then outranked by everything prepended after it: `brew shellenv`, the gnubin loop, `~/.local/bin`, `~/Scripts/bin`, `$PNPM_HOME`. mise ended at PATH position 24 against Homebrew's 10.

  The machine disagreed with itself as a result: a login shell served Homebrew's `node` 26.8.1, a non-login shell served mise's 24.18.1, and which `npm` ran came down to whether the shell was a login shell. mise is now activated **twice** — in `~/.zshenv` for coverage, and again at the end of `~/.zshrc` for precedence. `mise activate` registers its hook through `add-zsh-hook`, which is idempotent per function name, so the second call does not double-fire it (verified by counting `$precmd_functions`).

  **This changes which `node`, `python`, `go` and `ruby` your interactive shell serves** — they now resolve to the versions mise manages, which is what the documentation already claimed. Re-run the script (`--only shell`) and open a new shell for it to take effect.

- **repo**: **`nd` allowlisted in `.typos.toml`.** It is one of the binaries `@antfu/ni` actually ships (`na nci nd ni nlx nr nun nup`), but the `typos` pre-commit hook read it as "and" and silently rewrote the 7.9.0 entry's command list into a false one — turning a correct piece of documentation into a wrong one, as a hook auto-fix, with no review step. Reverted and allowlisted so it cannot happen again.

### Notes

- **Anthropic auth in pi is metered separately from your plan.** `pi` then `/login` works with a Claude Pro/Max subscription, but since 2026-04-04 Anthropic enforces server-side that third-party harness usage draws from **extra usage, billed per token**, not against plan limits. This is a deliberate, accepted cost; the Ollama path exists for long or exploratory loops.
- **`enabledModels` is deliberately absent from the generated `settings.json`.** Scoping it to `["anthropic/*"]` makes pi print `Warning: No models match pattern "anthropic/*"` on every run of a fresh machine, because the Anthropic catalog is empty until the first `/login`. A nag on a clean install is exactly the shape of the blocking `WARNING` that survived for releases in #327. Ctrl+P cycles the available models without it.

## [7.15.0] - 2026-08-29

Five fixes here, and they are all one bug: **a generated config file can be perfectly well-formed and sit at an address its tool never reads.**

The releases before this one chased failures that were silent. This class is quieter still, because it is not even a failure — the tool starts, finds nothing, falls back to its defaults, and works. asciinema had been ignoring its config since the 2.x/3.x format change. ngrok's seed template had never once been read. And the generated `~/.zshrc` exports `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, which relocated k9s, lazygit and nushell config out from under the `~/Library/Application Support` paths this script kept writing — so the Dracula skin k9s advertises had never applied to anything.

Two of the five *did* announce themselves. asciinema and nushell each printed a banner on every invocation, across releases, and both survived anyway: a banner naming a config file reads as advisory noise from a tool you use occasionally, not as "your settings are off". That is the shape of the blocking `WARNING` skimmed past in #327, and it is why the centrepiece here is a check rather than five patches.

That check is **`--verify`**, which asks each installed tool whether it actually reads what we generate. CI proves these files *parse* — necessary, and it caught #291 — but a file that parses perfectly and is read by nobody passes every check in the repo. The question can only be answered where the tools are installed. It found three of the five on its first run.

The counter-rule turned out to matter as much as the rule. A blanket "move everything to XDG" sweep would have broken two: VS Code is genuinely Library-based, and ngrok ignores `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` entirely. So this release moves ngrok *into* `~/Library/Application Support` and three other tools *out* of it. Per-tool, never per-directory — ask the tool, which is now what the script does.

**Re-run the script** (`--only configs`, or a full run): five config paths changed, and until it runs none of this has reached the machine. The run also clears the superseded copies, which is when the k9s skin applies and the asciinema and nushell banners stop. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **cli**: **`--verify` — does each tool actually read the config we generate?** CI proves every generated file *parses*, which is necessary and caught #291. It cannot prove anything *reads* one. #329 (asciinema) and #332 (ngrok) were both well-formed files sitting at paths their tool never looks at, and both passed CI for releases — one of them printing a warning on every single invocation the whole time.

  That question can only be answered where the tools are installed, so this is a script mode rather than a CI job. Each target declares how it can be checked:

  - **`validate`** — run the tool's own validator with **no path argument**. Success proves the tool found our file at *its* default location and accepted it: the path question and the format question answered in one shot. Ghostty's own docs describe the shape — "when executed without any arguments, this will load the config from the default location". Covers ghostty, zellij, ngrok and asciinema.
  - **`path`** — no validator, but the tool will say where it looks (`k9s info`, `mise config ls`, `lazygit --print-config-dir`, `atuin info`, `bat --config-file`, `nu -c '$nu.env-path'`). Compare that with where we write. This is the cheap check that catches the whole drift class: every instance found so far has been path drift, not syntax.
  - **`template`** — the file is a deliberately incomplete seed. A borgmatic config with no `repositories` cannot validate until the user fills it in, so that is reported as `SEED`, not as a failure. A check that always fails is one people learn to skim past, which is exactly how the blocking `WARNING` in #327 survived.
  - **`unchecked`** — neither is available. Listed by name so the gap stays visible instead of being quietly counted as a pass.

  An unrecognized mode warns loudly rather than matching no branch, following the rule #242 was written for: a row that silently matches nothing reads as "verified". `--verify` exits 1 when any tool is ignoring our config.

  It found three on its first run — k9s, lazygit and nushell, all sharing one root cause, filed as #333 (#336, closes #331)

### Changed

- **docs**: **AGENTS.md gains a section for the bug class behind #329, #332 and #333** — "A config can be valid and still be read by nobody". Four PRs in one session fixed the same defect and there was nothing written down that would have made anyone look for it. It records the symptoms, why no check in the repo catches it (the CI job proves a file parses; a file that parses and is read by nobody passes every time), and the fix: ask the tool for its path rather than hardcoding, pinning `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` on the query so the answer describes the post-setup machine. Plus the counter-rule that stops the obvious over-correction — VS Code is genuinely Library-based and ngrok ignores XDG, so the rule is per-tool, never per-directory.

  Also corrects the testing loop, which gave step 2 as `shellcheck -S warning` when CI runs it with `-x`, and notes that a green local ShellCheck is not proof CI is green: 0.11.0 passed a dead variable the runner's older build flagged as SC2034 (#339, closes #338)

- **internal**: **The "this config moved, clear the old copy" guard is one helper, `remove_superseded_managed`.** A path change is only half-delivered without it — writing the new file fixes fresh installs while every provisioned machine keeps the old one, and in each case so far that cost something visible (asciinema and nushell both printed a banner). #329, #333 and #334 needed the identical guard, so the fourth copy became a function instead: the file must carry our markers *and* hold nothing outside them, or it is left alone with a warning. Deliberately conservative — a `config.yaml` written by a pre-`write_managed` version has no markers to prove ownership, so it stays, and the warning says why (#337)

- **ci**: **The `generated-config` job parses the eight generated TOML files too** — `STARSHIP_CONF`, `ATUIN_CONF`, `MISE_CONF`, `TOPGRADE_CONF`, `TRIPPY_CONF`, `GIT_CLIFF_CONF`, `HARLEQUIN_CONF` and the new `ASCIINEMA_CONF` — via `tomllib`, which needs no extra install on the runner. All eight already parsed; the rows are there to keep them that way.

  The job's comment now also records what it **cannot** catch, because #329 walked straight past it: a file that parses perfectly and is read by nobody. The asciinema config was valid 2.x TOML-adjacent INI the whole time. Parsing is necessary, not sufficient — a new row is a prompt to also check the tool still reads that path and those keys (#330)

### Fixed

- **shell**: **k9s, lazygit and nushell config is written where those tools read it.** The generated `~/.zshrc` exports `XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"`, which moves the config location of every XDG-aware tool on the machine. Three config blocks still hardcoded `~/Library/Application Support`, so their files sat where the tool had stopped looking the moment that export landed. Nothing errored — the tools start, fall back to their defaults and carry on.

  k9s is the one with a visible symptom: the Dracula skin is a stated goal of this setup and has never applied. `~/.config/k9s/skins/` was empty while `dracula.yaml` sat in the Library tree. nushell said so out loud on every invocation — `Nushell will not move your configuration files from ~/Library/Application Support/nushell` — while loading `env.nu` from neither place.

  Found by `--verify` (#331) on its first run, which is the whole argument for having built it.

  Each path is now **asked of the tool** rather than assumed — `lazygit --print-config-dir`, `k9s info`, `nu -c '$nu.env-path'` — the way the bat block already did with `bat --config-dir`, so a tool that moves again is self-correcting. The query pins `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to the value our own `.zshrc` exports, because the honest question is not where the tool looks in whatever shell is running setup (possibly a bare bash on a fresh box that has never sourced the generated zshrc) but where it will look once setup is done.

  Not every Library path was wrong, and a blanket sweep would have broken two: **VS Code** is genuinely Library-based on macOS, and **ngrok** ignores `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` entirely — verified with `HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` both pointed at temp dirs. #334 deliberately moved ngrok *into* Library in the same release this moves three others out. The rule is per-tool; ask the tool (#337, closes #333)

- **network**: **The ngrok seed config is written where ngrok actually reads it.** The script wrote `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml`; ngrok on macOS reads `~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml` and nothing else. Verified against ngrok 3.39.11 with a temp `HOME` in both directions — with only the XDG file present, `ngrok config check` reports the Library path missing; add that file and it validates.

  ngrok itself has always worked, which is why nothing pointed at this. `ngrok config add-authtoken` writes to its own default (`--help`: `save in this config file (default …/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml)`), so the token lands in the file ngrok reads — only the seed template was stranded. That also falsified the comment justifying the create-once guard, which claimed `add-authtoken` "rewrites this same file". It rewrites a different one. The create-once trade from #277 is still right at the new path, where a token genuinely would be clobbered, and the reasoning now matches where the token goes.

  Found by the audit in #331 as the second instance of the class behind #329: a config that parses cleanly and is read by nobody. Both were path drift rather than syntax, and neither is visible to any check in the repo today.

  A stranded `~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml` is removed on the next run, but **only when it is byte-identical to the template we shipped**. Anything else may be a deliberate `ngrok --config` setup or an edited file, and either could hold an authtoken — those are left in place with a warning naming the real path. The file is never read, migrated or printed (#334, closes #332)

- **cli**: **`--dry-run` no longer creates the ngrok and Caddy config files.** Both #277 seed-template blocks used raw `mkdir -p` + `cat >` with no `DRY_RUN` guard — and because they do not go through `write_managed`, its built-in handling never applied. A `--dry-run` on a fresh machine wrote both files for real.

  It survives everyday use because it only fires when the directory is absent: on a provisioned machine both blocks take the `else` branch and report "already exists". A fresh machine is precisely where someone reaches for `--dry-run` first, so the one case where the flag is most likely to be used is the one case where it was wrong. Caddy is fixed alongside ngrok because it is the same two-line defect in the same idiom four lines away; its path, unlike ngrok's, was always correct — the template is used with an explicit `caddy run --config` (#334, closes #332)

- **terminal**: **The asciinema config is written in the 3.x format, at the path 3.x reads.** The script wrote `~/.config/asciinema/config` in the asciinema **2.x** INI format; the installed asciinema is **3.x**, which reads `~/.config/asciinema/config.toml` in TOML. Every setting was ignored, including `stdin = no` — the "don't record keystrokes" one. That setting happened to match 3.x's default (input capture is opt-in via `-I`), so nothing was ever captured, but the intent was not in force and would not have been had the default gone the other way.

  Unlike the recent run of silent no-ops (#311, #316, #321, #324), this one announced itself: asciinema prints a three-line `uses the location and format from asciinema 2.x` banner on **every** invocation. It survived anyway because the banner names a config file rather than a broken feature, so it reads as advisory noise from an occasional tool rather than "your settings are off" — the same way a `WARNING` that blocks a commit got skimmed past in #327.

  Keys move to `[session]`: `idle_time_limit` and `command` keep their names, `stdin = no` becomes `capture_input = false`. `overwrite` is dropped — 3.x has no config equivalent, only the `--overwrite` flag, and carrying a key that does nothing is the bug being fixed. All three surviving keys were verified against asciinema 3.2.1 rather than its docs: `session.capture_input` and `session.idle_time_limit` name themselves in its type errors, and `--help` documents `session.capture_input` and `session.command` as config options.

  Because the fix is a **path** change, writing the new file only helps fresh installs — an already-provisioned machine keeps the 2.x file beside it and goes on printing the banner forever. The old file is removed too, but only when it is provably ours: it must carry our markers *and* hold nothing outside them, the same test `write_managed` applies before deleting an outside region (#259). A file with edits outside the markers, or one this script never wrote, is left in place with a warning that says what to do with it (#330, closes #329)

## [7.14.3] - 2026-08-21

Both fixes here came from **auditing for a bug class rather than chasing a symptom**.

7.14.0 through 7.14.2 fixed three unrelated-looking things that turned out to share a shape: a pre-commit guard that skipped on every commit, a `PATH` entry that had never resolved, and two branch aliases that deleted nothing. None of them errored. Each failed by doing nothing and saying nothing, which is why all three survived months of daily use. So the script was searched for more of the same, and two were found.

`--skip prerequisites` was accepted and then discarded in silence — `prerequisites` was the only member of `ALL_CATEGORIES` whose section had no gate, so the flag validated (the "Unknown category" error even lists it as valid) and Xcode, Homebrew and `brew update` ran anyway. Notably the obvious fix was wrong: gating on `should_run` would have stopped `--only core` from installing Homebrew, so `--only core` on a fresh machine would refuse rather than bootstrap. Prerequisites are a precondition, not a peer category, and the gate now says so.

The second is smaller and the same family. Two of the pre-commit hook's three checks announced themselves as `WARNING` and then aborted the commit; a warning that blocks reads as advisory, so the line that actually stopped you is the one skimmed past. All three now say `ERROR`, which is what they all do.

The audit's negative results are worth as much as its findings: literal-`~` paths, all 59 shell alias targets, the git alias bodies, the cleanup dispatch from #242, every `should_run` category, and all eight pre-commit branches came back clean.

**Re-run the script** (`--only configs`, or a full run) for the hook labels; the `--skip` fix is in the script itself and applies immediately. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **git**: **The pre-commit hook's blocking checks all say `ERROR` now.** Two of its three checks announced themselves as `WARNING` and then `exit 1`, which aborts the commit — the debug-statement check and the large-file check. Only the merge-conflict check said `ERROR`. The behaviour was right in all three cases and is unchanged; the labels were not. A "WARNING" that blocks reads as advisory, so the natural first response to a refused commit is to look for whatever *else* went wrong, and the line that actually stopped you is the one skimmed past — the small version of what made #311 expensive. It also erodes the word for any genuine warning added later (#327, closes #325)

- **cli**: **`--skip prerequisites` is honoured instead of silently ignored.** `prerequisites` was the only member of `ALL_CATEGORIES` with no gate on its section, so the flag passed validation — the "Unknown category" error even lists it as valid — and was then discarded without a word: Xcode CLI Tools, Homebrew and `brew update` all ran anyway. An *unknown* category is rejected loudly and correctly, which is what made this stand out: it was the one value that validated and was then thrown away in silence. Found by auditing for the class shared by #311, #316 and #321.

  The gate is deliberately **not** `should_run "prerequisites"`, because prerequisites are a precondition rather than a peer category: under `should_run`, `--only core` would stop installing Homebrew, so `--only core` on a fresh machine would refuse to run at all instead of bootstrapping itself as it does today. The rule is narrower — run unless the user *explicitly* asked to skip. Verified across the matrix: no flags, `--only core`, `--only prerequisites` and `--skip docs` all still run them; only `--skip prerequisites` does not.

  Skipping is refused when the machine does not already have them — `Cannot skip prerequisites: Homebrew not installed`, exit 1 — because everything afterwards needs `brew` and the failure would otherwise arrive much later as a wall of unrelated errors. And the skip path still exports `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`, which the skipped section used to set: without it every later `brew_install` would auto-update, so skipping the slow networked step would have caused *more* of it (#326, closes #324)

## [7.14.2] - 2026-08-21

Two branch-cleanup aliases that have probably never once done anything.

`git cleanup` and `git gone` both leaned on **ancestry**, and squash merging breaks that: it writes a *new* commit to `main` that the branch tip is not an ancestor of. Since `gh pm` is `pr merge --squash --delete-branch`, and this setup's own standards mandate squash merging, that is every repository here. `cleanup` failed at selection and then died on `xargs` with `fatal: branch name required`; `gone` selected correctly and then failed at deletion, because `-d` applies the same ancestry test and refuses. Neither said so — a clean repo and a repo with twenty dead branches looked alike, which is how this survived months of daily use. It surfaced on a repo carrying 21 stale local branches that `git cleanup` declined to touch.

The fix follows the signal that is actually correct for this workflow: **the remote branch is gone**, which is precisely what `--delete-branch` leaves behind. That is what `gone` now selects on, deleting with `-D` and printing the short SHA to restore each branch from, since `-D` gives up git's safety net and the echoed SHA is what replaces it. `cleanup` delegates to it.

The care went into what a force delete must *not* eat, and the answer is structural rather than defensive: a branch with no upstream has no `[gone]` marker, so unpushed local work is never selected at all. Verified against a repo holding one squash-merged-and-deleted branch, one never-pushed branch with real work in it, one pushed branch whose remote is alive, and one gone branch that is currently checked out.

**Re-run the script** (`--only configs`, or a full run) to pick up the aliases. The first `git cleanup` afterwards may delete a lot at once on a long-lived repo — the restore SHAs it prints are the undo. No breaking changes, though `cleanup` no longer covers the merge-commit workflow, deliberately.

### Fixed

- **git**: **`git cleanup` and `git gone` now actually delete branches.** Both were broken by squash merging, which is what `gh pm` (`pr merge --squash --delete-branch`) does and therefore what every repository here uses — so between them they have very likely never deleted a single branch. Found on a repo carrying **21** stale local branches that `git cleanup` declined to touch.

  A squash merge writes a **new** commit to `main` that the branch tip is not an ancestor of, and both aliases leaned on ancestry, in two different places. `cleanup` failed at *selection*: `git branch --merged main` is an ancestry test, so a squash-merged branch is never listed — and with no input, `xargs -n 1 git branch -d` ran with no argument and died on `fatal: branch name required`, which reads as a usage error rather than "nothing to do". `gone` failed at *deletion*: its selection was always right, because `--delete-branch` really does leave the local branch tracking a `[gone]` upstream, but it then passed the branch to `-d`, which applies the same ancestry test and refuses with `not fully merged`.

  Neither said so. The failure was a **silent no-op** — a clean repo and a repo with 20 dead branches produced near-identical output — which is why it survived months of daily use.

  `gone` now selects on the upstream being `[gone]` (via `for-each-ref`, so no `$1` has to survive three levels of quoting) and deletes with `-D`, printing each branch with the short SHA to restore it from: `deleted feature/x (ab2956c) - restore with: git branch feature/x ab2956c`. `-D` gives up git's ancestry safety net, and that echoed SHA is what replaces it. Finding nothing now says so. `cleanup` delegates to `gone` — ancestry selection is the bug, so there is only one correct implementation and `cleanup` is a second name for it.

  Care was taken over what `-D` must **not** eat. Verified against a repo built with one squash-merged-and-deleted branch, one never-pushed branch holding real work, one pushed branch whose remote is alive, and one gone branch that is currently checked out: only the first is deleted, the unpushed work survives with its content intact, the live branch survives, the checked-out one is skipped with `switch away first`, and the printed restore command was run and does restore the branch and its content (#322, closes #321)

## [7.14.1] - 2026-08-19

A one-line PATH fix, for a path that was already there and had never worked.

`dotnet tool install -g` puts binaries in `~/.dotnet/tools`, and the .NET installer ships a PATH entry for it — `/etc/paths.d/dotnet-cli-tools`, containing the **literal string** `~/.dotnet/tools`. `path_helper` copies entries out of that directory verbatim and does not expand `~`, so the entry resolves to a directory named `~`, relative to wherever you happen to be, and matches nothing anywhere. The path is plainly visible in `echo $PATH` while every binary under it is unreachable — which is precisely why this survived: the evidence you would check first says it is configured.

Found through the failure this repo treats as the worst kind. A `snapshot-check` pre-commit hook in another repository needs `ilspycmd`, could not resolve it, and skipped — on every commit, on the machine the hook was written for. It skips *loudly*, by deliberate design, so it was a visible no-op rather than a false pass; it was still a guard that had never once run.

`$HOME/.dotnet/tools` is now asserted in `~/.zprofile` and `~/.zshrc`, the same two places Go, bun and pnpm are already handled, guarded on the directory existing. Microsoft's dead `/etc/paths.d` entry is left alone — this setup does not edit system PATH files it did not write, and a broken entry behind a working one is harmless.

**Re-run the script** (`--only configs,shell`, or a full run) and open a new shell. This does **not** install the .NET SDK; whether it should is [#318](https://github.com/vixygrey/vixygrey-dev-setup/issues/318). No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **shell**: **`~/.dotnet/tools` is now on `PATH`**, so binaries from `dotnet tool install -g` are actually reachable. The .NET installer *does* ship a PATH entry for this and it has never worked: `/etc/paths.d/dotnet-cli-tools` contains the **literal string `~/.dotnet/tools`**, and `path_helper` copies entries from that directory verbatim without expanding `~` — so the entry resolves to a directory named `~`, relative to wherever you happen to be, and never matches anything. `echo $PATH` shows the path present; `command -v ilspycmd` finds nothing. A tool installs "successfully" and is invisible to every shell, script, and git hook on the machine.

  Found when a `snapshot-check` pre-commit hook in another repository skipped on every commit because `ilspycmd` could not be resolved — a guard that never fired on the machine it was written for, which is the failure mode this setup treats as worse than a loud error. Re-asserted with `$HOME` in both `~/.zprofile` and `~/.zshrc`, matching how Go, bun and pnpm are already handled, and guarded on the directory existing so it is inert on a machine with no .NET.

  The dead `/etc/paths.d/dotnet-cli-tools` entry belongs to Microsoft's installer and is deliberately left alone — this setup does not edit system PATH files it did not create. **This does not install the .NET SDK**; it only makes tools that are already installed reachable. Whether the SDK itself belongs in this setup is a separate question, tracked in #318 (#317, closes #316)

## [7.14.0] - 2026-08-19

One bug, its fix, and the hole the fix left — all in Git LFS.

Setting `core.hooksPath` hands this setup a directory it does not own: **git-lfs is `core.hooksPath` aware**, so `git lfs install` writes its four hooks into it from any repository. 7.5.0's hook delegator then preserved that hook and ran it faithfully everywhere, which meant `git lfs pre-push` executed on **every push on the machine** — including in repositories that have never held a single LFS object. Usually that costs nothing but a wasted lock-verification round-trip. Against a **GitHub wiki** it costs the push: the lock API cannot authorise a wiki push at all, so an account with full push access still gets `You must have push access to verify locks`, the hook exits non-zero, and the chain aborts exactly as the hook contract requires. Every wiki push, on every machine this script had run on, with an error naming authentication — sending you after a token you did not need.

The delegator was never wrong; the question was only whether git-lfs should be chained *unconditionally*. A global hook cannot know which repositories use LFS, so it no longer tries: the LFS hooks are discarded, and repositories that actually use LFS opt in with a new **`git-lfs-enable-repo`**. That helper exists because `git lfs install --local` **cannot** do the job — `--local` governs where the *config* goes, not the hooks, so with `core.hooksPath` set git-lfs writes them globally regardless.

Which left one thing worse than the bug it replaced. A repository that uses LFS and never runs the opt-in has no hook to upload its objects, so `git push` uploads the **pointer files alone — and succeeds**, leaving the remote broken for whoever clones next. A trap that fails silently is not an improvement on one that fails loudly, so the `pre-push` chain now refuses that push outright. Warning was considered and rejected: a warning scrolls past and does not stop the bad push, which is the whole point.

**Re-run the script** (`--only configs,filesystem,shell`, or a full run) — already-provisioned machines have their chained LFS hooks purged automatically. No breaking changes, unless you were relying on the global LFS hooks, in which case run `git-lfs-enable-repo` once per LFS repository.

### Added

- **git**: **The `pre-push` chain now refuses a push that would upload LFS pointers without their objects.** Not chaining git-lfs globally (see below) left exactly one failure mode that is *silent*: a repository that tracks paths through the lfs filter but never ran `git-lfs-enable-repo` has no hook to upload its LFS objects, so `git push` uploads the pointer files alone — and **succeeds**. Nothing reports it; the breakage surfaces later, to whoever clones next and gets `Encountered 1 file that should have been a pointer, but wasn't`.

  The check is `git ls-files ':(attr:filter=lfs)'` — one git call, no `git-lfs` fork, ~20ms on a 365-file repo and empty (so short-circuiting) on any repo that does not use LFS — plus a grep for an LFS `pre-push` hook. It **aborts** rather than warns, which is the deliberate answer to the open question the issue was filed with: a warning scrolls past in push output and would not stop the bad push, which is the entire point of catching it. Unlike the wiki case in #311 this cannot misfire on a healthy repository — LFS-tracked paths with no LFS hook is always a misconfiguration — so the abort has no false-positive class to trade against. `git push --no-verify` still bypasses it, and `git config dev-setup.lfsguard false` disables it per repo for anyone pushing their LFS objects some other way (CI, a mirror).

  Verified with eight cases driving real `git push` operations against local remotes: a plain repo unaffected, an LFS repo with no hook refused, the same repo allowed after `git-lfs-enable-repo`, the per-repo opt-out honoured, `--no-verify` bypassing, the guard scoped to `pre-push` only (a `post-checkout` delegator is untouched), an LFS repo whose repo hook is husky's still refused, and the short-circuit cost measured (#314, closes #313)

### Fixed

- **git**: **Git LFS is no longer chained into the global hook directory**, because chaining it ran `git lfs pre-push` on *every* push on the machine. git-lfs 3.7.1 is `core.hooksPath` aware, so `git lfs install` writes its four hooks into the same global directory this setup manages, from any repository; 7.5.0's delegator then dutifully preserved that hook and ran it everywhere — including in repositories that have never held a single LFS object. Usually that only costs a wasted lock-verification round-trip. Against a **GitHub wiki** it costs the push: the lock API cannot authorise a wiki push at all, so an account with full push access still gets `Authentication error: Authentication required: You must have push access to verify locks`, the hook exits non-zero, and `run_hook_chain` aborts on the first non-zero status exactly as the hook contract requires. Every wiki push on every machine this script had run on was blocked, and the error named authentication — so the natural response was to go hunting for a token, which is the wrong subsystem entirely.

  The delegator was not at fault and is unchanged; the question was only whether git-lfs should be chained unconditionally, and the answer is no. A *global* hook cannot know which repositories use LFS, so `preserve_foreign_hook` now **discards** git-lfs hooks rather than preserving them, and purges copies left in `<type>.d/` by earlier versions — so a machine provisioned while LFS was still chained is repaired on the next run instead of keeping the hook forever. Nothing is lost by deleting them: `git lfs install` re-creates them on demand, and git-lfs *refuses* to overwrite an existing foreign hook (`Hook already exists`, exit 2), so the delegators keep their names and the arrangement is self-maintaining rather than a race. Foreign hooks that are not git-lfs are still preserved and chained exactly as before.

  Verified with a seven-case suite over the real `preserve_foreign_hook` — previously-preserved `10-git-lfs` purged, a fresh global git-lfs hook discarded, a **non**-LFS hook still preserved as `10-preexisting`, a co-resident non-LFS link untouched by the purge, `--dry-run` mutating nothing, our own delegator skipped, and the empty case a no-op — plus an end-to-end test driving real `git push` operations through the generated delegator against a local remote, confirming the chain still runs a repository's own `pre-push` as link 1 (#312, closes #311)

### Added

- **git**: **`git-lfs-enable-repo`** (alias `lfsinit`) — opts a single repository into Git LFS by writing the four LFS hooks into `.git/hooks`, where the global delegator runs them as the repository's own hook. This exists because **`git lfs install --local` cannot do it**: `--local` governs where the *config* is written, not the hooks, so with `core.hooksPath` set git-lfs writes the hooks globally anyway — which is the behaviour that caused the bug above (verified against git-lfs 3.7.1). The helper is idempotent, sets the repo-local `filter.lfs.*` config, and refuses to overwrite an unrelated existing hook rather than clobbering husky or lint-staged, printing the line to merge by hand instead.

  **This step is required in any repository that uses LFS.** Skipping it means `git push` uploads the pointer files without the objects behind them, and the push *succeeds* — leaving the remote broken. That is the cost of not running LFS globally, and it is called out in the generated `TOOL_REFERENCE` entry at the point of use, in `AGENTS.md`, and here, precisely because the failure is silent (#312, closes #311)

## [7.13.0] - 2026-08-17

A same-day follow-up to 7.12.0, because that release shipped something nobody chose. Installing `ms-python.python` for VS Code silently pulled in **Pylance** through its `extensionPack` — Microsoft's proprietary, closed-source Python type server — and Pylance does not sit quietly: `python.languageServer` defaults to `Default`, which resolves *to Pylance* whenever it is installed. So VS Code was analysing Python with the exact server this setup had already rejected in 7.10.0, when it chose **basedpyright** for croft on the grounds that it is the same code with the closed-source parts restored as open source.

The result was two editors running two different Python toolchains, which is precisely what 7.12.0's premise — match the extension set to the CLIs already installed, so the GUI editor cannot disagree with the terminal — was supposed to rule out. Fixed by installing basedpyright, removing Pylance, and pinning `python.languageServer` to `None` so the setting, not the mere absence of a package, is what keeps basedpyright in place.

The lesson generalises past this one extension: **an `extensionPack` is a supply chain**. Vetting the 26 IDs added in 7.12.0 was not the same as vetting what they install, and the four extras only surfaced because the installed list was read back and compared against the intended one. Worth doing again the next time a pack-style dependency enters the setup.

**Re-run the script** (`--only dx` then `--only configs`, or a full run) to swap the server. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **dx**: **VS Code no longer runs Pylance.** Installing `ms-python.python` in 7.12.0 silently pulled in three more extensions through its `extensionPack` — `debugpy`, `vscode-python-envs`, and **`vscode-pylance`**, Microsoft's *proprietary*, closed-source Python type server, licensed for use only with Microsoft products. That contradicted a decision this repo had already made on purpose: 7.10.0 installed **basedpyright** for croft precisely because it is the same server with the closed-source parts restored as open source (#296). Pylance is the thing that choice rejected, and it arrived through a dependency rather than a decision.

  It was not inert, either. `python.languageServer` defaults to `Default`, which resolves **to Pylance** whenever Pylance is installed — so Pylance, not basedpyright or ruff, was what actually analysed Python in VS Code, with its own telemetry. The two editors were running different Python toolchains, which is the exact outcome matching the extension set to the installed CLIs was meant to prevent.

  Now: `detachhead.basedpyright` is installed, Pylance is uninstalled, and the settings pin `python.languageServer: "None"` so ms-python starts no server of its own, plus `basedpyright.importStrategy: "fromEnvironment"` so it uses the `uv`-installed basedpyright already on PATH rather than its bundled copy (that is already the upstream default; setting it explicitly guards against a future change and records the intent). `debugpy` and `vscode-python-envs` are kept — both MIT and genuinely useful.

  The removal runs **at the install site on every run**, not through `DEPRECATED_TOOLS`, following the `tlrc` precedent from 7.11.0: a swap left to `--cleanup` only ever reaches fresh machines. Pylance ships as a pack member to every machine that installs `ms-python.python`, so the removal has to run where the install runs. Verified from the installed manifest that it is an `extensionPack` and not `extensionDependencies`, so Pylance can be removed independently without VS Code refusing or breaking `ms-python.python`; and that the `python.languageServer` enum really is `Default, Jedi, Pylance, None` (#308)

## [7.12.0] - 2026-08-17

A GUI editor comes back. croft has been the only editor here since Helix was retired, and it is a good one — but a terminal IDE is not the right tool for every job, and the 7.x declutter had left the machine with **zero** GUI options after removing all three Electron editors at once. The objection was to running VS Code *and* Cursor *and* Kiro; dropping to none overshot it. croft stays primary and is unchanged; VS Code returns beside it, carrying the same rules through 26 extensions and a merged `settings.json` so the two editors cannot disagree with each other or with the CLI.

The question that started it also produced a finding worth recording: **croft has no EditorConfig support** — verified against croft 0.1.700, no reference to it anywhere in the source. Its indentation is a language default (2 spaces for YAML, 4 otherwise) plus a per-buffer status-bar override that does not persist, and because croft's extensions are pure-data `extension.toml` manifests, a reader cannot be added as one. On a repo with an `.editorconfig`, the two editors will disagree until you flip croft's status-bar pill. That is now written into the generated `CLAUDE.md` and `TOOL_REFERENCE` rather than left to be rediscovered.

The reinstatement was also not just an install. VS Code was being *actively removed* — it sat in `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` so `--cleanup` uninstalled the cask, and both its per-user trees sat in `ORPHANED_EDITOR_DIRS` so cleanup trashed `~/.vscode` and `~/Library/Application Support/Code`. Adding the install alone would have shipped a script that installs VS Code and then deletes its extensions on the next `--cleanup`.

**Re-run the script** to get VS Code, its extensions, and the settings file. No breaking changes. Cursor and Kiro stay retired.

### Added

- **dx**: **Visual Studio Code is back**, as the *GUI* editor alongside croft rather than instead of it. The 7.x declutter removed all three Electron editors (VS Code, Cursor, Kiro) on the reasoning that croft plus Claude Code covered the ground; running three overlapping editors was the actual objection, and dropping to **zero** GUI editors overshot it. croft remains primary and is unchanged. VS Code is the escape hatch for what a TUI still loses at — long refactors across many tabs, graphical diffs and merge conflicts — and for `.editorconfig` repos, since **croft has no EditorConfig support** (verified against croft 0.1.700: no reference anywhere in its source; indentation is a language default of 2 spaces for YAML / 4 otherwise, plus a per-buffer status-bar override that does not persist).

  Reinstating it meant *stopping* two active removals, not just adding an install. VS Code sat in `DEPRECATED_TOOLS`, so `--cleanup` uninstalled the cask; and both its per-user trees sat in `ORPHANED_EDITOR_DIRS`, so cleanup trashed `~/.vscode` and `~/Library/Application Support/Code`. Both entries are gone, each with a comment recording why it must not come back — the `.app`-present guard would spare those trees on a healthy machine, but a failed cask install or an app moved out of `/Applications` would have made cleanup eat a tree the script now manages. **Cursor and Kiro stay retired.**

  **26 extensions**, every one mirroring a CLI this script already installs, so the GUI editor enforces the same rules as the terminal instead of quietly disagreeing with it: Ruff (not black), Even Better TOML (taplo), ShellCheck + shell-format (shfmt), D2, just, Docker, Terraform, Tailwind, GitHub PRs + Actions, GitLens, Error Lens, Code Spell Checker, Dracula, EditorConfig, Claude Code, and the Python/Rust/Go/YAML language extensions. Every ID was **verified against the marketplace before landing** — a wrong one is not a loud failure, just `code` exiting non-zero into one red line of a 300-line run, which is the same class of defect as the docs that named tools nothing installed (#237, #238) (#303)

- **dx**: A **`vscode_ext_install`** helper, following the `npm_global_install` shape (resume state, `DRY_RUN`, progress). Two details are load-bearing: the installed-extension list is read **once** into `_VSCODE_EXTS` rather than per extension, because `code --list-extensions` boots Electron and 26 sequential calls cost ~26s of nothing on an already-provisioned machine; and the new helper name is added to the **`_INSTALL_CALLS`** pattern, without which its 26 calls run un-counted and the progress bar overshoots 100%. That pattern's comment now says so explicitly, since it had already drifted out of date (it listed three of the five existing helpers) (#303)

- **dracula**: VS Code joins the themed set, keeping the category's "Dracula theme for all tools" promise honest. The theme name is written as **`Dracula Theme`** — the exact `contributes.themes[].label` from the extension manifest, confirmed against the published `package.json`. `"Dracula"` is the plausible-looking value and it silently does nothing: an unknown theme name leaves the default in place with no error, exactly the "unknown keys are silently ignored" trap (#206) (#303)

- **configs**: A merged VS Code **`settings.json`** (Dracula, format-on-save, ruff for Python, prettier for web, shfmt for shell, tabs for Go, LF endings, telemetry off, JetBrains Mono / JetBrainsMono Nerd Font in the integrated terminal so starship and eza glyphs render). It follows the **micro** precedent rather than `write_managed`, for the same two reasons: JSON has no comment syntax for the managed markers, and VS Code rewrites the file itself whenever a setting is changed from the UI. The merge is `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'` with the **on-disk file winning**, so hand edits and anything Settings Sync pulls down survive a re-run while new defaults still reach existing machines.

  The VS Code-specific trap is that `settings.json` is **JSONC**: a file with `//` comments or a trailing comma is valid to VS Code and invalid to `jq`. That merge fails, and the script **warns and leaves the file completely alone** rather than overwriting — verified both ways, that a user's theme/fontSize/custom keys survive a merge and that a JSONC file comes through byte-identical (#303)

- **ci**: **`MICRO_CONF`** joins the generated-config parse gate, closing a blind spot in the check that exists precisely to catch it. The gate hands each generated heredoc to the real parser that will read it, and `~/.config/micro/settings.json` — valid JSON, `jq` available — was never in the table; it predates the gate, which is why. micro's failure mode is the quiet kind that makes the gap worth closing rather than shrugging at: an unparsable settings file means micro falls back to defaults, so the first symptom is the Dracula theme and the house indent rules silently not applying, not an error. Verified with the same `extract()` snippet the workflow uses (30 lines, parses clean, `colorscheme=dracula-tc`) and by injecting a trailing comma to confirm the gate fails on it. Spotted while adding `VSCODE_CONF` to the same table in #304 and deliberately kept out of that PR (#305)

## [7.11.0] - 2026-08-17

Prompted by asking what the preflight's `brew doctor found issues` line was actually reporting — a line that fires on every run because two of the warnings it counts are permanent by design, and which therefore had a genuine finding sitting inside it unread. Three things came out: the `common-fate/granted` tap was never trusted on a machine that already had granted, so Homebrew was silently ignoring every formula in it; the `tldr` formula is **disabled** upstream, meaning a fresh machine could not install it at all; and both Quick Look plugins are gone, Finder preview not being part of this workflow. **Re-run with `--cleanup`** to retire the old `tldr` formula and the two casks. No breaking changes — `tlrc` provides the same `tldr` command.

### Changed

- **replacements**: Swap the **`tldr` formula for `tlrc`**, the official Rust client. The old formula is deprecated *and* **disabled** upstream (`unmaintained`), meaning a fresh machine could not install it at all — a provisioning failure waiting to happen, surviving here only because it predated the disable. `tlrc` provides the same `tldr` command, so the generated Justfile's `cheat` recipe and every documented `tldr <cmd>` invocation keep working. It `conflicts_with` the old formula, so an existing install is uninstalled first *at the install site* rather than being left to `--cleanup`: otherwise brew would refuse and the swap would only ever reach fresh machines. `tldr` is also added to `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` so `--cleanup` handles it like other swaps (#301, part of #299)
- **mac-system**: **Drop both Quick Look plugins**, QLMarkdown and QLStephen, along with the `qlmanage -r` reload that existed only to register them. Finder preview is not part of this workflow — files get read in the terminal — and `qlstephen` was deprecated upstream (`no_longer_meets_criteria`) while QuickLookJSON had already been disabled, so the section was shrinking toward zero on its own. Both are retired through `DEPRECATED_TOOLS`, so `--cleanup` removes them from machines that have them, and the `mac-system` category description no longer promises them (#301, closes #299)

### Fixed

- **aws**: The `common-fate/granted` tap was never trusted on a machine that already had granted, so Homebrew **silently ignored every formula and cask in it** — including updates to granted itself — and `brew doctor` reported it on every run. `trust_tap common-fate/granted` sat inside the `else` of an `if installed granted || installed assume` guard, so the only path that trusted the tap was the one taken when granted was *absent*. Any machine that installed it before Homebrew 6 introduced the trust gate kept an untrusted tap permanently, with no way for a re-run to repair it. It was the only one of the **21** `trust_tap` calls placed inside a conditional; the other twenty run unconditionally, which is why nothing else was affected. Now hoisted above the guard — trusting is idempotent, so doing it every run costs nothing. Verified by stubbing the helpers and running the block with granted present: the trust call fires where it previously printed only `Granted already installed`. Surfaced by asking what the preflight's `brew doctor found issues` line was actually reporting, which is worth noting: two of those warnings (non-prefixed `coreutils`/`findutils`) are permanent by design, so the line fires on every run and a genuine finding sat inside it unread (#300, closes #298)

## [7.10.0] - 2026-08-17

Closes out the last of the open issues. Python finally gets full language-server coverage — `ty` and `basedpyright`, the two servers croft's own built-in manifest names and neither of which was installed, leaving croft to fall through to `ruff` alone. And CI now hands every generated config to the tool that will actually read it: `just`, `zsh`, `jq` and `yq` across twelve files. That gate exists because 7.9.1 shipped a justfile the `just` parser rejected while ShellCheck passed and a generator-vs-disk comparison agreed with itself — the kind of failure only the real parser catches. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **dx**: Install **`ty`** and **`basedpyright`**, the two Python language servers croft expects. Python was the one language here without full LSP coverage: only `ruff` was installed, which lints and formats but does no type checking, completion or go-to-definition. The choice was not a judgement call in the end — **croft ships a built-in manifest that names them by exact command**, `Python (ty + basedpyright + ruff)`, with its own comment: *"`ty` is registered first (lowest priority) so it wins every capability it advertises; basedpyright is the fallback; ruff lints."* Both were absent, so croft fell through to `ruff` alone. That manifest also answers the question the issue flagged as decisive — whether croft can run several Python servers at once — with a documented priority chain rather than a guess. Installed via `uv tool` (both are PyPI), matching how `rovr` and `manly` are installed and the project's uv-not-pip rule; **basedpyright** rather than Microsoft's pyright, being the same server with the closed-source parts restored as open source. `ty` is at 0.0.72 and clearly preview, which is exactly why basedpyright sits behind it — the fallback is croft's own mitigation, not an extra (#296, closes #288)

- **ci**: The generated-config gate now covers **YAML** — eight files (`lazygit`, the k9s Dracula skin, `gh`, `gh-dash`, `stern`, `lazydocker`, `ngrok`, `borgmatic`), validated with `yq`. This closes the research in #278 with a decision rather than a tool purchase: **`yq` only, no `yamllint`**. Two findings settled it. First, `yq` silently accepts duplicate keys — `gui:` twice parses fine and the last one wins — so it does not catch the case that motivated the question; but that case **cannot arise in the generator**, because duplicates come from concatenation *on disk* (the pre-#130 append), and there is nothing to duplicate inside a single heredoc. Second, the on-disk case is already controlled: `write_managed` removes exact duplicates (#261) and the run reports whatever is left outside the markers. So the honest answer to *"would validating the generator's output have caught #259?"* is **no**, and adding `yamllint` would have bought style noise on files that are otherwise fine rather than the check that was wanted. Verified by injecting malformed YAML into the k9s skin heredoc and confirming the gate fails (#295, closes #278)

- **ci**: `lint.yml` gains a **generated-config parse gate**. The generator can be syntactically perfect bash and still emit a file the consuming tool cannot read — 7.9.1 wrote `export GLAB_PAGER="delta"` into the global justfile, invalid `just` syntax, and lost all ~18 recipes (#291). ShellCheck passed. So did a generator-vs-disk comparison, because the broken file on disk matched the broken generator exactly; **agreement with the generator is not correctness**. The only check that catches this class is handing the generated text to the real parser, which is what the job now does: `just --list` on the extracted `JUSTFILE_CONF`, `zsh -n` on `MANAGED_ZSHRC`, and `jq empty` on `CLAUDE_SETTINGS_CONF` and `PRETTIER_CONF`. Checks are a `tag|validator` table, so covering a new generated file is one row. An **empty extraction is a hard failure** rather than a silent pass — a renamed heredoc would otherwise make every check below it vacuously succeed, which is exactly the silent no-op this repo keeps getting bitten by. Verified by reintroducing four real breakages and confirming each is caught: the #291 justfile export, an unbalanced `if` in the zshrc block, a malformed `settings.json`, and a renamed heredoc tag (#294)

## [7.9.2] - 2026-08-17

Repairs a regression 7.9.1 introduced: an invalid line was written into `~/.justfile`, so it stopped parsing and **every global `gj` recipe was unusable**. If you ran 7.9.1, re-run the script — `~/.justfile` is a managed block and is rewritten in place. The cause is worth recording: the offending edit was anchored on a string that appears twice in the generator and landed in the wrong heredoc, and three separate checks passed while the file was broken — including a generator-vs-disk comparison, because the broken file on disk matched the broken generator exactly. Agreement with the generator is not correctness. Both generated artifacts are now parse-checked directly.

### Fixed

- **just**: 7.9.1 wrote an invalid line into `~/.justfile`, so `gj` failed to parse and **all ~18 global recipes were unusable** (`error: expected '*', ':', '$', identifier, or '+', but found end of line`). #286 added `export GLAB_PAGER="delta"` intended for the `~/.zshrc` managed block, but anchored the edit on `alias gj="just --justfile ~/.justfile --working-directory ."` — a string that appears **twice** in the generator, once as a "Tip:" comment inside the `JUSTFILE_CONF` heredoc and once in the real alias list. A single-occurrence replace took the first, so the export landed in the justfile, where `export X="y"` is not valid syntax (just uses `export X := "y"`). The export now sits in the zshrc block, anchored on a string unique to it, with a comment recording why it must not move. Two lessons went into the verification rather than the prose: #286 tested the `glab` block thoroughly and never re-parsed the two files it had actually edited, and a generator-vs-disk sweep reported **110/112 matching** the whole time — because the broken `~/.justfile` on disk faithfully matched the broken generator. Agreement with the generator is not correctness. Both artifacts are now parse-checked directly: `just --justfile <generated> --list` (18 recipes) and `zsh -n` on the extracted zshrc block (#292, closes #291)

## [7.9.1] - 2026-08-17

Two corrections to things that claimed to work and did not. Configuring `glab` failed twice on every run — the pager key it set is rejected by glab, and one alias name collides with a real glab command — while the script printed an unconditional success line naming both. And `README.md` still documented **Helix** as an installed, configured editor a dozen releases after it was deliberately retired, naming it as the editor for gh, lazygit and leaf where the script sets `micro`. Both were found by reading a normal run's output and then checking each claim against the generator. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **glab**: Two steps failed on every run, both swallowed by `|| true`, after which the script printed an unconditional `glab configured (SSH, micro, delta; gh-style aliases…)` — claiming a pager that was never set and an alias set that was incomplete. `glab config set glab_pager delta` is **rejected by glab 1.113.0** (`"Glab_pager" is not a recognized glab config key`) even though `glab config` help documents that key, and plain `pager` is refused too, so the call could only ever error; it is removed, and `GLAB_PAGER=delta` is exported from `~/.zshrc` instead, where glab ignoring it costs nothing. Marked best-effort deliberately: a pager only engages on a TTY and `script -q /dev/null` cannot allocate one in this environment, so the env var is documented as unverified rather than claimed to work. Separately, the `rc|repo clone` row could never be created because **`glab rc` is a real command** (runner controllers) — of the 12 aliases advertised, 11 existed and `rc` silently did not, while `gh rc` works; it becomes **`rcl`**, the nearest free name, since gh-parity is impossible for that one. Failures are now counted and reported (`glab configured with N problem(s)`) instead of a fixed success line, and each unset alias warns by name. `README.md` described glab twice as *"SSH, Helix, delta"* — Helix was retired in 7.6.0 and the editor is `micro`, and the delta half was never true. Verified by running the block: 0 errors, all 15 aliases present including `rcl`. Two incidental findings recorded while testing: `glab config set` fails with `not a Git repository` when the working directory is not a repo, which the new warning would now surface; and the alias heredoc is a **data table** where every line is parsed as `alias|command`, so it cannot carry comments — a first attempt at this fix put explanatory `#` lines inside it and created two aliases named after the comments (#286, closes #285)
- **docs**: `README.md` still presented **Helix** as an installed, configured editor. It was retired in 7.6.0 — deliberately, replaced by micro as `$EDITOR` and croft as the IDE — and the script now *uninstalls* it via `DEPRECATED_TOOLS`, yet the README documented a Helix tool row, a Dracula theme for it, a generated `~/.config/helix/config.toml` (never written — `grep -c` returns 0, and the directory does not exist), and named Helix as the editor for gh, lazygit and leaf where the script sets **micro** in all three. The whole *"Helix Language Servers"* section was built on a dead premise (`hx --health`, built-in LSP) even though the servers themselves are alive and useful: the script installs them **for croft**, as its own comments say (`used by croft`, `croft LSP`). Section retitled and re-pointed, with a note that the servers are plain LSP binaries any editor can consume. Also corrected a k9s row claiming `$EDITOR=hx` for edit-resource — no editor key exists in the generated k9s config or on disk — and dropped the `llm` row's reference to a Helix `Alt+a` pipe, a keybinding that lived in the config no longer written. **micro** gained a tool-table row in the process: it is the `$EDITOR` and was documented nowhere, while the editor it replaced had four entries. Every replacement was checked against the generator rather than renamed on sight (`"colorscheme": "dracula-tc"`, `editor: micro`, `edit: 'micro {{filename}}'`, leaf's own comment), and the script's **8** Helix references — the retirement row, the `hx|~/.config/helix|micro` migration mapping, the `--uninstall` cleanup lines and two history comments — are deliberately left intact (#289, closes #287)

## [7.9.0] - 2026-08-17

Establishes one convention for agent instructions across every repo on the machine: **`AGENTS.md` is tracked and public, `CLAUDE.md` is private and never committed.** The public file is written for whoever contributes — short, free of personal preference, pointing at documents that already exist; the private one holds personal lessons and preferences. `new-project` had this exactly inverted, scaffolding a *public* `CLAUDE.md` full of project context, so every project it created committed the wrong file. The global gitignore now backs the per-repo rule, because a forgotten line publishes private notes and that cannot be undone once pushed. This repo follows the convention it defines. Minor rather than patch: `new-project` and `/init-project` scaffold a different file than before. Nothing breaks — the generated global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` keeps its name and its role.

### Added

- **convention**: Adopt one agent-instructions convention machine-wide: **`AGENTS.md`** tracked and public, **`CLAUDE.md`** untracked and private. `AGENTS.md` is written for whoever contributes — short, no personal preference, pointing at the documents that already exist rather than restating them; `CLAUDE.md` holds personal lessons and preferences and is never committed. Verified before adopting rather than assumed: **Claude Code 2.1.220 discovers `AGENTS.md`** (its binary carries the literal string `Claude Code hardcodes CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md discovery` alongside 7 `AGENTS.md` references), and it is the name the wider agent ecosystem converged on, so one public file serves every tool. Four changes carry it: the generated global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` documents the split so any session applies it unprompted; `~/.gitignore_global` gains `CLAUDE.md`, because a forgotten per-repo line publishes private notes and that cannot be undone once pushed (a repo that genuinely wants it tracked can still `git add -f`); `~/Scripts/bin/new-project` now scaffolds `AGENTS.md` — previously it wrote a **public** `CLAUDE.md` containing Overview/Tech Stack/Development/Conventions, which is exactly the content the convention says must be public, under the name the convention says must not be — and appends the `CLAUDE.md` line to the new repo's own `.gitignore` so the rule is visible to collaborators; and the `/init-project` slash command's step 3 was rewritten to match. `~/Code/personal/qud-mods/qud-expanded/AGENTS.md` is cited as the reference for the file's shape (#283, closes #282)

### Changed

- **repo**: This repository now follows the convention it defines: `CLAUDE.md` is renamed to `AGENTS.md` (tracked) and `CLAUDE.md` is gitignored here for private notes. The project instructions still load — Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` by the same discovery path. Live references to the `/init-project` scaffold in `README.md`, `docs/SHORTCUTS.md` and `docs/GUIDE.md` were updated; `CHANGELOG.md` mentions of `CLAUDE.md` are left untouched as a historical record, as are the many references to the generated global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, which keeps its name (#283)

## [7.8.4] - 2026-08-17

A release about things this setup was doing to your machine on your behalf that it had no business doing. It reformatted repositories that never opted into prettier and rewrote Python — deleting imports — in repositories that never opted into ruff. It asked for your admin password on every run, `--dry-run` included, without naming a single step it needed the password for. And it froze the Claude agents and slash commands it generates behind a create-once guard, so corrections never reached a machine that already had them: `dep-audit` was still telling Claude to run bare `pip` where the generator says `uv pip`. Three of these hid behind swallowed output or a guard that made the bug unobservable. Re-running applies all of it, and the run now tells you which generated files it refreshed. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **Claude config**: The Claude subagents and slash commands were **create-once** — gated on `[[ -d "$DIR" ]] && [[ -n "$(ls -A "$DIR")" ]]`, so a single pre-existing file froze the entire set of 2 agents and 20 commands and no later edit or addition ever reached a provisioned machine. This is the #226 pattern, applied there to the global `CLAUDE.md` and `rules/` but never to these neighbours. It was not hypothetical: on the development machine `dep-audit.md` still told Claude to run **`pip audit`** and **`pip list --outdated`** where the generator says `uv pip audit` / `uv pip list --outdated` — a slash command instructing the exact tool this setup's own standards forbid, frozen there for however many releases. Neither agents nor commands can carry managed-block markers (an agent's YAML frontmatter must be line 1, and a slash command *is* the prompt, so a marker line would be fed to the model as instruction), so they now use a new **`write_generated`** helper: rewrite only when the content differs, backing up whatever it replaces as `<file>.replaced.<timestamp>` so a local edit stays recoverable, and reporting what it refreshed in the run summary. The freeze had also been hiding a **regression in the generator itself**: the `init-project` command's GitHub Actions snippet had lost the indentation under `jobs: / ci:`, making it invalid workflow YAML — invisible precisely because no machine could receive it. Fixed and validated with `yq` before shipping, so the refresh does not propagate it. Separately, the ngrok and Caddy configs stay create-once **deliberately** and now say why in the code: both are seed templates the user is expected to edit (`ngrok config add-authtoken`, which `POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST` instructs, rewrites `ngrok.yml` to store the token; the Caddyfile is a commented-out starting point), so refreshing either would destroy user data. Verified with a 12-case suite: creates when absent, no-ops and writes no backup when identical, refreshes a changed file on a machine that already has it, lands a newly added file, keeps a local edit recoverable, records to the summary, and writes nothing under `--dry-run` (#280, closes #277)
- **Claude hooks**: `lint-python` ran `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` on **every** `.py` file Claude edited, in **every** repository on the machine, with no project opt-in of any kind — and `ruff check --fix` rewrites code rather than whitespace. Demonstrated in a throwaway repo with no config anywhere: a file containing `import os` / `import sys` came back with **both imports deleted** and the body reformatted (`Found 2 errors (2 fixed, 0 remaining). 1 file reformatted`). An import kept for its side effects — plugin or codec registration, `matplotlib.use`, Django signal modules, `import readline` — is removed and the program breaks at runtime, not at edit time; a project standardised on black silently gets ruff's formatting instead; and `2>/dev/null || true` swallows both the successes and the failures, the same concealment that hid #268 for several releases. The sibling `format-on-edit` hook documents the intended policy — *"only format if a prettier config exists in the project"* — and this one never had it. It now walks up from the edited file for `ruff.toml`, `.ruff.toml`, or a `[tool.ruff]` section in `pyproject.toml`, stopping **before `$HOME`** so a global config cannot stand in for a project opting in (the #268 mistake). `--fix` is kept for projects that did opt in, because configuring ruff is asking for exactly that behaviour. Verified with a 6-case suite against a fake `$HOME` holding a global `ruff.toml`: an unconfigured project, a black-configured project and a file loose in `$HOME` are all untouched, a side-effect `import readline` survives, and projects with `ruff.toml` or `[tool.ruff]` are still formatted (#279, closes #276)
- **docs**: The `just` entry in `TOOL_REFERENCE` and the `POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST` never mentioned the global `~/.justfile` this setup writes, or the **`gj`** alias that runs its ~18 recipes (`gj --list`, `gj flush-dns`) — `grep -c "gj " ~/Desktop/TOOL_REFERENCE.md ~/Desktop/POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` returned 0 and 0, so anyone working from the Desktop docs never learned the recipes existed. Both now document it, and the end-of-run config line names the invocation. **Correction to #273**, which shipped in this same unreleased window: that PR was filed and written on the premise that nothing documented the global justfile at all, and it added a *second* alias, `jg` (`just -g`), to fix it. That premise was wrong — `alias gj="just --justfile ~/.justfile --working-directory ."` already existed, and `docs/SHORTCUTS.md` already had a full **Global Justfile Recipes** section plus a `gj` row. The investigation had piped its search through a filter that excluded the `alias gj=` line and had only checked `~/Desktop/*.md`, never `docs/SHORTCUTS.md`. The duplicate `jg` alias is removed and every doc added by #273 now points at the pre-existing `gj`, leaving one alias for the job instead of two differing by a letter transposition (#275, closes #271)
- **docs**: Two rows in `docs/SHORTCUTS.md` named tools this script never installs: `y` was documented as `yazi` (the script sets `alias y="rovr"`) and `md` as `glow` (the script sets `alias md="leaf"`). Neither yazi nor glow is installed — `brew_install` is called for neither — so both rows described a tool that does not exist on the machine, aliased to a name that does something else. Leftovers from the TUI swaps that repointed the aliases without updating the doc; `SHORTCUTS.md` ships in the release zip, so both were user-facing. Same class as #237/#238 (#275, closes #274)
- **CLI**: The script asked for your **admin password on every run**, including `--dry-run` — a mode whose whole promise is that it changes nothing — and the prompt named no step it would be used for. Reported after a stretch of testing produced a stream of password requests with no explanation of what they were for, which is exactly the signal a person should treat as suspicious; making it routine is a security cost, not just an annoyance. The admin check is now **scoped to what the run will actually do**: it asks only when a selected category has a privileged step, and it names them — `system settings (display sleep, DNS servers, startup chime, network time) and Touch ID for sudo (macos-defaults)`, `removing pre-installed Apple apps from /Applications (mac-bloat)`. Nothing else in the script needs root; the one `sudo` inside the `configs` segment is in the generated Justfile's `flush-dns` recipe, which is written to disk for later use and never executed by setup — so `--only configs`, the command this project tells you to run to refresh configuration, no longer prompts at all. `--dry-run` never asks, whatever is selected. The mapping is a table validated against `ALL_CATEGORIES` at startup, so a typo'd key fails loudly instead of silently dropping a category's requirement and surfacing as a password prompt from the middle of a run. Also fixed the sudo keepalive, which tested whether the parent was still alive only *after* sleeping: if the script exited immediately after a check, the loop refreshed the sudo timestamp once more and lingered up to 50 s. It now tests liveness before each refresh (`while kill -0 "$$"`), which also removes the need for the trailing `|| exit`. Verified with a 17-case logic suite over `--only`/`--skip`/`--dry-run` combinations, an end-to-end check that dry runs produce no prompt, and a stubbed-sudo render of the new message — no live install was run, deliberately, since verifying one means more password prompts (#270, closes #269)
- **Claude hooks**: `format-on-edit` is meant to reformat a file only if the project opted into prettier, but the guard never worked: it walked **up** from the edited file looking for a prettier config and stopped only at `/`, so it passed through `$HOME` — where this same setup installs a global `~/.prettierrc`. Every path under `$HOME` therefore satisfied "this project uses prettier", and the hook reformatted repos that had never asked for it. It went unnoticed for as long as it existed because the duplicated `~/.prettierrc` from #259 made prettier fail on every file and the hook swallows failures; repairing that config in 7.8.2 brought the hook to life and this behaviour with it. The visible symptom was Markdown: prettier normalises emphasis to underscores (not configurable), so adding one entry to this repo's own `CHANGELOG.md` produced a 22-insertion/16-deletion diff that rewrote `*between*` → `_between_` inside released 7.8.0 and 7.8.1 notes. The walk now stops **before** `$HOME`, restoring the documented intent for every file type — a project is formatted only if it carries its own prettier config, and a loose file sitting directly in `$HOME` is not a project. **`md` was deliberately left in the extension list**: with the guard fixed, Markdown is only touched inside a project that opted in, where formatting it is that project's choice — and `.prettierignore` remains the standard way to exclude it (verified: `*.md` in `.prettierignore` leaves the file alone, without it prettier restyles the emphasis). Verified with a 7-case suite driving the generated hook against a fake `$HOME` containing a global `~/.prettierrc`: a project with no config is untouched (js and md), an opted-in project is still formatted including from a deeply nested path, a file directly in `$HOME` is skipped, notes under `~/Documents` are skipped, and non-matching extensions are ignored (#272, closes #268)

## [7.8.3] - 2026-08-17

One fix, for a failure mode 7.8.2 made easy to hit: after a run finishes, the script asks whether to reload your shell — and while it waited there it kept holding the lock, so the next run was refused with `Another instance is running`. The prompt comes after the success banner, so it reads as finished; one run sat on it for five and a half hours and blocked everything after it. The lock is now released when the work ends rather than when the process exits, the refusal says how long the holder has been idle and how to clear it, and a new `--no-prompt` flag lets callers that cannot answer a question — CI, a detached pane, an editor's run-in-terminal button — run without ever blocking. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **CLI**: A run that had **finished all of its work** kept holding the lock while it sat at the final `Source ~/.zshrc now to activate everything? [Y/n]` prompt, so every later run was refused with `Another instance is running (PID: N)` — true, but it reads as "work in progress" when in fact that instance completed hours earlier and was safe to kill. Hit in practice: a run launched through an editor's *run in terminal* button finished its work in about 40 seconds, then held the lock for **5 hours 30 minutes** parked on that question, because the prompt sits *after* the success banner and is easy to walk away from. Anything that starts the script where nobody is watching — a detached pane, an SSH session you disconnect from, a scheduled run — ends the same way. The lock is now released as soon as the work is done, **before** the prompt, since answering it is not work (the `exec zsh -l` branch already released it; the decline branch and walking away did not). Two supporting changes: the refusal now reports how long the holder has been running, the timestamp of its last log activity and the `kill` that clears it, so an idle holder is obvious instead of needing a process-stack sample to diagnose; and a new **`--no-prompt`** flag declines every optional prompt without blocking, for callers that cannot answer one (it is refused together with `--interactive`, which is a prompt by definition). Verified with an 11-assertion suite: `--no-prompt` completes without hanging, the lock is gone while a run sits at the prompt, a second run is *not* refused in that state, a genuinely concurrent run *is* still refused and now says how to recover, and the flag conflict is rejected (#266, closes #265)

## [7.8.2] - 2026-08-17

A repair release for four silent failures — the kind that report success and leave the machine wrong. Git hooks were the worst of them: `core.hooksPath` made every per-repo hook on the machine dead except `pre-commit`, so husky, lint-staged and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hooks never ran and never said so. Alongside that, `write_managed` could never repair a config carrying a duplicate of its own block — which had `prettier` failing on every project under `$HOME` and 18 more configs quietly duplicated — and `--only <category>` refreshed none of that category's configuration while reporting `Failed: 0`. **Re-run the script**: the config repairs and the new hook delegators are applied to already-provisioned machines automatically, and the run now tells you what it repaired. No breaking changes.

### Changed

- **CLI**: `--only <category>` refreshed **none** of that category's configuration and reported success anyway. Category gates gate only the **install** sections; every generated config file is written in one ordered `configs` segment further down (with starship in `dracula`, `~/Scripts/*` in `filesystem` and `~/.zshrc` in `shell`), so the obvious way to apply a fix to the global pre-commit hook — `--only git`, right after #257 landed — ran for 18 s, printed `Installed: 10, Skipped: 22, Failed: 0`, and left the hook byte-for-byte unchanged. Nothing in the output suggested a no-op; it was caught only by diffing the installed hook afterwards. The `git` category description made it worse by listing `pre-commit`, which reads as the hook rather than the framework package it actually installs. A run using `--only` now prints, **before the work and again beside the completion summary**, exactly what it is not refreshing — `git: the global pre-commit hook, lazygit, gh, git-cliff, the commit template, global gitignore` — and the command that would (`--only git,configs`). The mapping behind that notice is a table whose keys are validated against `ALL_CATEGORIES` at startup, so a typo'd category fails loudly rather than yielding a notice that can never fire (the #241/#242 lesson applied to a lookup rather than a `case`). `--list-categories` now leads with the install-vs-config split instead of burying `configs` at the bottom of a 32-entry list where `head` never reaches it, `--help` documents pairing `configs` with `--only`, and the `git` and `configs` descriptions say what they actually cover. The split itself is unchanged — one ordered `configs` segment is deliberate — and is now written down in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` for the next contributor (#262, closes #258)

### Fixed

- **git**: Setting `core.hooksPath` makes git read **only** that directory — per-repo `.git/hooks` is never consulted, for any hook type — and the script shipped exactly one hook into it. So every other per-repo hook on the machine was dead: husky's `commit-msg`, a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s `pre-push`, lint-staged, `post-checkout`/`post-merge`, all of it, silently, with no error and no output. Found when a `no-commit-to-main` hook in another repo never ran. Every hook type now gets a delegator, and the delegator **chains** rather than `exec`s: it runs the repository's own hook of that name, then any third-party hook preserved in `<type>.d/`, aborting on the first non-zero status. Chaining is not a nicety — **git-lfs 3.7.1 is `core.hooksPath` aware** and installs its four hooks into this same global directory from any repo, so a delegator that only ran the per-repo hook would have silently disabled LFS smudge and upload machine-wide. Pre-existing third-party hooks are moved to `<type>.d/` before a delegator takes the name, idempotently: `git lfs install` rewrites its hooks on every invocation, and an identical copy that is already preserved is dropped rather than stacked. Hook types that receive data on **stdin** (`pre-push`, `post-rewrite`, `push-to-checkout`) have it buffered once and replayed to every link, since stdin can only be consumed by the first reader — without that, a chained git-lfs `pre-push` would see an empty ref list and upload nothing. A repo with its own `pre-commit` still owns the policy: this hook used to `exec` it, so the generic debug/large-file/conflict checks never ran alongside, and that is preserved deliberately rather than newly blocking commits that were fine yesterday. The per-repo hook is resolved through `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` — **not** `--git-path hooks/<type>`, which is itself `core.hooksPath` aware and resolves straight back to the delegator, making it run itself forever and hanging every `git commit` on the machine (caught in testing; there is also an explicit guard refusing to re-enter the global directory). Verified with a 14-case suite driving real `git commit`/`push`/`worktree` operations against the generated hooks — per-repo hooks firing for non-`pre-commit` types, a failing hook still blocking, repo-then-third-party ordering, identical stdin reaching both links, the `#257` empty-staged amend, a missing chain library never blocking git, and resolution from inside a linked worktree — run 8 times consecutively, plus an 11-case suite for the preservation/migration path (#263, closes #260)
- **docs**: The generated `pre-commit` reference now explains why `pre-commit install` fails on this machine (`Cowardly refusing to install hooks with core.hooksPath set`) and gives the unset/reinstall/restore workaround. The script installs `pre-commit` itself, so it shipped a tool that did not work out of the box and an error that does not explain itself (#263)
- **configs**: `write_managed` could never repair a config carrying a **duplicate copy of its own block outside the markers**, because the marker-to-marker rewrite only touches the region *between* the markers — so a stray copy sat above (or below) the block forever, and re-running the script, the documented remedy for everything else, could not fix it. One of those files was broken outright: `~/.prettierrc` has no extension and is parsed as **YAML**, where a clean managed block is *accidentally* valid (a JSON object is a YAML flow mapping and `#` starts a comment) but two top-level objects are not a valid YAML stream — so `prettier` failed on **every** project under `$HOME` without a config of its own, with `Unexpected flow-map-start token in YAML stream`. Fresh installs were never affected; only machines upgraded across the pre-#130 `write_managed`, which **appended** its block to marker-less files instead of replacing them (#130 fixed the appending, not the files it had already damaged). The blast radius was much wider than the one loud failure: **19** generated configs were frozen in a duplicated state on the development machine — `~/.aws/config`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.vimrc`, `~/.editorconfig`, `~/.curlrc`, `~/.shellcheckrc`, the k9s Dracula skin and the nushell `env.nu` among them — each merely redundant rather than fatal only because its format happens to be last-key-wins. `write_managed` now splits the file around its markers and drops an outside region **only when it exactly duplicates content known to be ours**: either the block being written, or the block already between the markers (which an earlier run of this script wrote, so a stray copy of *that* is ours too — this is what catches duplicates left by an older version whose content has since drifted, e.g. `~/.nanorc` and `~/.aria2/aria2.conf`). Everything else is preserved byte-for-byte, which is the whole safety argument: `~/.ssh/config` `Include`/`Host` entries, `~/.aws/config` profiles, `~/.npmrc` tokens and `~/.zshrc` edits are all legitimate outside-marker content, none of it can match a generated block, and deleting outside content on any looser test — such as the "replace the file wholesale" repair the issue originally proposed — would have destroyed it. Whatever is still outside the markers after a run is reported in one dim line at the end rather than a per-file warning, so a drifted duplicate surfaces instead of staying invisible while `~/.zshrc` and `~/.ssh/config` do not train you to ignore the notice. The bookkeeping behind that notice is a temp **file**, not a shell array, because `write_managed` fed through a pipe rather than a heredoc runs in a subshell where array appends are silently discarded while the on-disk repair still happens — the exact silent-no-op shape this script keeps getting bitten by. Verified with a 24-case suite (duplicate above/below the block, drifted duplicate, user content preserved, `//` comment prefix, missing end marker, idempotent re-run, dry-run mutates nothing) plus a run of the real heredocs against copies of the damaged files, asserting `prettier` loads and formats with the repaired config and that the unrepaired original still errors (#261, closes #259)
- **git**: The global pre-commit hook blocked **every `git commit --amend`** that staged no new changes — which is the normal case for amending — with a false `ERROR: Merge conflict markers found in staged files.` Since the hook is registered through `core.hooksPath`, this broke amending in every repo on the machine. The conflict-marker check tested the exit status of a pipeline ending in `xargs`, so it read *xargs's* status rather than *grep's*; with an empty staged set, `-r` (`--no-run-if-empty`) makes xargs run nothing and exit **0**, which the `if` took as "grep found markers" — so the check fired precisely when there was nothing to check (`printf '' | xargs -0 -r grep -lE 'nevermatches'` exits 0, versus 123 with a real file and no match). `-r` itself was correct: without it, `grep` with no file arguments would block reading stdin. The check now uses the same empty-safe `while IFS= read -r -d ''` loop the debug-statement and large-file checks above it already use — which is exactly why *those* never had this bug — and this was the last check still relying on an xargs exit status. The regex is untouched, so the anchoring that fixed the earlier `=======` setext false positive is unaffected. The message now also names the offending files and how to bypass, matching the other two checks; naming none is part of why this read as a real conflict rather than a hook bug. Verified by extracting the heredoc into a throwaway `git init` and running seven cases (normal commit, empty-staged amend, real markers still blocked, setext `=======`, Markdown pipe table, spaced filename, second amend) — all pass here, and the same suite fails exactly the two amend cases against the pre-fix script. Already-provisioned machines pick it up on the next run: the hook is written by `write_managed_script`, which rewrites in place between the managed markers (#257, closes #256)

## [7.8.1] - 2026-08-15

A single critical stability fix. The clipse clipboard listener installed by 7.8.0 and earlier leaked a ~110 MB process every 10 seconds and eventually hard-crashed the machine — `WindowServer` watchdog `forceReset`, preceded by hours of stutter and beachballs as RAM ran out. If you are on any earlier version, **re-run the script**: the repair is applied automatically to already-provisioned machines, and orphaned listeners are reaped in the process. To stop the bleeding immediately without re-running, `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.clipse.listener.plist && clipse -kill`. No breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **clipse**: The clipboard-listener LaunchAgent leaked a ~110 MB `clipse` process **every 10 seconds**, exhausting RAM and ending in a `WindowServer` watchdog hard reset (68 orphans holding 7.4 GB after 15 minutes of uptime on a 24 GB machine). The agent ran `clipse -listen`, which *daemonizes* — it forks a detached listener and the supervised parent exits immediately — so `KeepAlive` made launchd respawn the job on its 10 s throttle while every previously detached listener kept running, unreaped. The generated plist now uses **`-listen-darwin`**, the foreground variant, which is what launchd needs in order to supervise a single listener. The leak also amplified itself: clipse shells out to `osascript` (`tell application "System Events" to get name of first application process whose frontmost is true`) to tag each clipboard entry with its source app, **once per clipboard change per listener** — so with ~886 orphaned listeners a single copy fired ~886 concurrent AppleEvents at a single-threaded System Events. The crash chain ran: RAM exhaustion → `JetsamEvent` and compressor thrash (the stutter) → `System Events` saturates → stuck `osascript` processes pile up, each holding a LaunchServices connection → `launchservicesd` hits its 512 dispatch-thread hard limit → `WindowServer`'s *synchronous* LaunchServices call blocks → watchdog `forceReset`. **This also fixes already-provisioned machines**: the block was `is_done` + `[[ -f ]]` create-once, so every existing install had the broken plist frozen on disk and re-running the script would never have repaired it — it now rewrites in place whenever the content differs and reaps orphans with `clipse -kill` (#254, closes #253)

## [7.8.0] - 2026-08-14

Local-AI/Workspace provisioning gaps closed plus a round of Ghostty/SketchyBar desktop-UX fixes. Herald's local AI was only half-provisioned: setup seeded a chat model (`llama3.2`) but no embedding model, so herald's semantic search had nothing to run on out of the box — this swaps the default chat model to the newer `gemma3:4b`, adds `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe` as the embedding model, and refactors the pull step into an idempotent loop. Separately, `gws auth setup` died with "gcloud CLI not found" on every fresh machine because the script never installed the Google Cloud SDK that `gws` depends on. And the Ghostty quick-terminal launcher got three fixes — a global new-window keybind that lands on the current Space, a keep-alive agent so the cmd+space hotkey survives quitting Ghostty, and `quick-terminal-screen = mouse` for multi-display — alongside moving the SketchyBar clock to the far left of the bar. No breaking changes; re-run the script to pick everything up.

### Changed

- **dx**: Seed **two** default Ollama models instead of one. The chat model default moves from `llama3.2` to **`gemma3:4b`** (Gemma 3 4B — newer and more capable at a similar size), and **`nomic-embed-text-v2-moe`** (a ~0.96 GB, 768-dim embedding model) is now pulled as the backend for herald's semantic search, which previously had no model seeded at all. The pull step is now a data-driven loop over an `OLLAMA_DEFAULT_MODELS` list with an `ollama_model_present` helper that matches an installed model by exact name or its implicit `:latest` tag, so re-runs skip models already present. Generated docs (POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST, TOOL_REFERENCE, TOOLKIT_SUMMARY) were updated to name both models and describe the chat/embeddings split. Existing machines that already pulled `llama3.2` keep it — this changes the default pull set, not a forced removal; run `ollama rm llama3.2` to reclaim the space (#246)
- **dx**: Ghostty quick-terminal ergonomics. Added a global **`cmd+alt+t=new_window`** keybind that drops a new Ghostty window onto the *current* macOS Space — the `a` app launcher uses `open`, which for an already-running app only re-activates its existing window (yanking you to whatever Space it lives on), so there was no way to summon a terminal onto the Space you're actually on. Also switched `quick-terminal-screen` from `main` to **`mouse`** so on multi-display setups the dropdown appears on the display under the cursor (identical to `main` on a single display). And moved the **SketchyBar clock (date/time) to the far left of the bar**, immediately left of the focused-app name (was the leftmost item of the right cluster) (#250)

### Fixed

- **gws**: Install the **`gcloud` CLI** (Homebrew cask, renamed from `google-cloud-sdk` to `gcloud-cli`) alongside `googleworkspace-cli`. `gws auth setup` shells out to `gcloud` to bootstrap its OAuth project, so without it the very first auth step failed with `gcloud CLI not found` and `gws` was unusable out of the box — the checklist told users to run a command that could not succeed. The install is idempotent, so already-provisioned machines pick up `gcloud` on their next re-run; the POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST now notes that setup provides the `gcloud` CLI `gws auth setup` needs (#248)
- **dx**: Ghostty's global quick-terminal hotkey no longer dies when you quit Ghostty. The auto-start LaunchAgent was `RunAtLoad`-only, so an accidental ⌘Q left the cmd+space hotkey dead until a manual relaunch. It's now **KeepAlive** via `open -gW -a Ghostty` — `-W` makes the launcher process wait for Ghostty to exit so launchd tracks it and relaunches within seconds, while `-g` keeps it background (no login focus-steal), and `-W` attaching to an already-running instance means reloading never spawns a duplicate. The plist block was also **double create-once guarded** (`is_done` + an `-f` existence skip), so already-provisioned machines would never have received this change; it's now content-diffed and refreshed on every run. Unload the agent (`launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ghostty.autostart.plist`) to stop Ghostty for good (#250)

## [7.7.1] - 2026-08-13

A cleanup-correctness patch. `--cleanup` had been quietly under-removing: every `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` entry typed `brew:` (a synonym for `formula:` the dispatch never handled) fell through the removal `case`, so a dozen retired formulae were reported "already clean" while they sat installed. This release makes `--cleanup` actually remove them and adds a loud default so no future entry can silently no-op. No breaking changes; re-run the script (with `--cleanup`) to pick it up.

### Fixed

- **cleanup**: Fix `--cleanup` silently skipping every `brew:`-typed entry in `DEPRECATED_TOOLS`, so a dozen retired formulae (helix, tmux, aider, repomix, aerc, khal, vdirsyncer, yazi, cmus, kew, tokei, glow) were **never uninstalled** even when present. The removal loop's `case "$type"` only had branches for `formula`, `cask`, and `mas`; the 12 entries whose type field was `brew` (a synonym for `formula`) matched no branch and fell straight through — not removed, not even counted, so the run reported "0 removed, N not found (already clean)" while the tools sat installed. Added `brew` as an accepted alias (`formula|brew)`) and a `*)` default branch that warns loudly on any unknown type, so a future type typo can never again be a silent no-op. Fix is live script logic (not a create-once generated file), so any already-provisioned machine picks it up the next time it runs `--cleanup`

## [7.7.0] - 2026-08-13

Herald and `croft pair` both advertised a local, no-key AI path backed by Ollama — but nothing installed Ollama, so that path was dead on every provisioned machine. This release makes it real: the script installs Ollama, runs it as a login service on `127.0.0.1:11434`, and pulls a small default model (`llama3.2`) for herald's triage/summaries/compose. Alongside it, a wave of documentation corrections untangles when an Anthropic API key is actually needed — `croft pair` rides your existing `claude` CLI auth, herald's MCP rides your `claude` login, and the `llm` CLI is the only thing that wants a key (and even that is optional) — plus a fix to the `ni` reference, which documented a non-existent `nx` command (it's `nlx`). No breaking changes; re-run the script to pick everything up.

### Added

- **dx**: Install **Ollama** (Homebrew formula) as the local LLM backend for **herald**'s built-in AI (triage, summaries, compose styler) and `croft pair --provider ollama`. Both default to a local Ollama server on `127.0.0.1:11434`, but nothing previously installed it — the only mentions of Ollama in the script were doc strings promising a "local, no-key" AI path that didn't actually exist. The install block runs `ollama` as a login service (`brew services start ollama`) so herald's default endpoint is always live, waits for the server to accept connections, then pulls a small general model (`llama3.2`, ~2 GB) for herald's text tasks — all idempotent and `--dry-run`-honoring (the pull skips when the model is already present). Ollama needs no config file (models live under `~/.ollama`), so nothing is hand-written; herald still self-configures its own `conf.yaml` through onboarding, where you pick the Ollama provider + model. Also reworded the herald/croft POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST and TOOLKIT_SUMMARY lines that referenced Ollama so they match reality, added a `~/.ollama` entry to the state-dir listing, and added a `TOOL_REFERENCE` section for `ollama`. Existing machines pick it all up on the next re-run (#237)

### Fixed

- **docs**: Fix the `TOOL_REFERENCE` entry for `ni`, which documented a `nx` command (prose "*`nx` executes a package binary*" and the example `nx eslint .`) that does not exist — the installed `@antfu/ni` package ships `na nci nd ni nlx nr nun nup`, and the package-binary runner is **`nlx`** (the npx equivalent), not `nx`. Corrected both the prose and the example to `nlx`. Doc-only change in the `REFERENCE_EOF` heredoc; the Desktop `TOOL_REFERENCE.md` regenerates on the next run (#238)

- **docs**: Correct the generated docs that presented `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as **required** for `croft pair`. It isn't — `croft pair` defaults to `--provider claude`, which `croft pair --help` describes as *"handed to the claude CLI on the default provider,"* so it shells out to the user's existing `claude` CLI and rides whatever auth that already has (a Claude Pro/Max subscription **or** an API key); `--provider ollama` runs a fully local model with no key at all. The API key is only genuinely needed for the `llm` tool (`llm-anthropic`), which stays documented as such. Reworded the POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST and TOOLKIT_SUMMARY heredocs plus the croft-install code comment in `setup-dev-tools-mac.sh`; the Desktop docs are regenerated fresh on every run, so a re-run picks the correction up with no migration needed (#235)

- **docs**: Continue the same `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`-is-not-required cleanup for **herald** and **`llm`** across the POST_SETUP_CHECKLIST and TOOLKIT_SUMMARY heredocs. The herald items now state plainly that no Anthropic key is needed to use herald with Claude — asking Claude Code to read/search mail and calendar goes through herald's MCP and rides the existing `claude` login, while herald's *own* built-in AI (triage/summaries/compose) stays optional and defaults to local Ollama. The `llm` items are reframed from *"the one thing that genuinely needs an Anthropic key"* to **optional**: the key is only used by the `llm` CLI, and `llm` itself is skippable if Claude Code and the desktop app already cover the user. Desktop docs regenerate on every run, so no migration needed (#236)

## [7.6.1] - 2026-08-12

A small quality-of-life release for the status bar. Because the setup auto-hides the native macOS menu bar, Shottr's own menu-bar icon is normally out of reach — this release gives SketchyBar a camera glyph that stands in for it, opening a click-to-capture menu (Area / Window / Fullscreen / Scrolling) driven through Shottr's `shottr://` URL scheme. No breaking changes; re-run the script to pick it up.

### Added

- **dx**: Add a **Shottr capture menu to SketchyBar** — a camera glyph in the right cluster (just right of the clock) that stands in for Shottr's own menu-bar icon, which is otherwise hidden by the auto-hidden native menu bar (#232). Left-click opens a vertical popup menu with **Area / Window / Fullscreen / Scrolling** entries; right-click is a quick area grab. Each entry drives Shottr through its `shottr://grab/*` URL scheme (verified against the app bundle's registered scheme and route table), so no keystroke simulation or Accessibility dependency beyond what SketchyBar already needs. The menu auto-closes on `mouse.exited.global`. Five new Nerd Font glyphs were added to `icons.sh` and confirmed to render in JetBrainsMono Nerd Font; two plugins (`shottr_click.sh` dispatcher, `shottr.sh` exit handler) follow the existing `click_script`/`script` pattern used by the bluetooth and vpn items. Screen Recording permission for Shottr (already in the post-setup checklist) is all that's required for captures to include app windows

## [7.6.0] - 2026-08-12

A Claude Code correctness release. An audit of everything this script generates for Claude found the same failure repeatedly: the generator was right, but provisioned machines never received the correction — most starkly, the `PostToolUse` hooks were schema-invalid and had **never run on any machine this script provisioned**, and the global `CLAUDE.md` was frozen 33 lines behind the generator with no mechanism to catch up. Both now migrate existing installs rather than only fresh ones. The shell aliases were breaking every agent-run `du -sh`, `rm -rf` and `pip install` and are now interactive-only. `--cleanup` grew from uninstalling packages to also reclaiming editor trees, config dirs, dead taps and orphaned dependencies (~1.5 GB on the maintainer's machine). Two tool changes: **reminders-cli** added so "remind me" reaches iPhone/Watch, and **Helix replaced by micro** — non-modal, with the key bindings kept on screen. No breaking changes; re-run the script to pick everything up.

### Added

- **dx**: Install **micro** as the `$EDITOR`, replacing Helix. Modal editing was friction rather than help here; micro is the opposite trade — non-modal (`Ctrl+S`/`Ctrl+Q`/`Ctrl+C`-`V`, no modes to enter or leave) with a **`keymenu` strip that keeps the bindings on screen** and `Ctrl+G` for the full reference, which was the actual ask. It ships **`dracula-tc` as a built-in colorscheme**, so unlike Helix there is no theme file to maintain. Configured to the house standards: 2-space indents (4 for Python, real tabs for Go and Makefiles), trailing whitespace stripped and EOF newline on save, persistent undo/cursor/history, mouse and system clipboard. `croft` remains the primary IDE — which also fixes a standing mismatch where croft was documented as primary while `EDITOR` still pointed at `hx` (#229)

- **mac-productivity**: Install **`reminders-cli`** (`keith/formulae`, binary `reminders`) so Apple Reminders are reachable from the terminal — the one gap between the existing productivity tools, since `tiki` keeps tasks in git and `herald` owns mail and calendar events, but neither can create an alert that follows you to iPhone/Watch via iCloud. The generated `CLAUDE.md` now draws that three-way line explicitly and tells Claude that "remind me" means this tool, with reads free and mutations gated on explicit user intent. Only the read-only verb is auto-approved in `settings.json` (`Bash(reminders show*)`) — `add`/`complete`/`delete` still prompt. Ships a `TOOL_REFERENCE.md` entry and a checklist step for the one-time macOS Reminders consent prompt, which is granted to the terminal rather than to the binary and silently yields empty results until approved (#208)

### Changed

- **cleanup**: `--cleanup` now runs **`brew autoremove`** before `brew cleanup`, completing the coverage work from #210 and #214. `brew cleanup` only purges download caches and outdated versions — it never removes the dependencies an uninstalled formula pulled in, so every retirement left residue. The live case: `aider` is slated for removal and is the *sole dependent* of `python@3.12`, so uninstalling it orphaned an entire Python installation that nothing reclaimed. Safe by construction — Homebrew records whether each formula was installed on request or as a dependency, and `autoremove` only considers the latter (on the audited machine: 176 on-request formulae are untouchable, 183 dependency-installed ones are candidates only while nothing depends on them). `--dry-run` previews the orphan count and removes nothing (#224)
- **cleanup**: `--cleanup` now also removes **orphaned config dirs and empty taps**, closing the rest of the gap found in #210 — it previously uninstalled packages and apps but left everything those tools wrote. Config removal is guarded on **binary presence rather than a static list**, so a tool you still use keeps its config, and because the sweep runs after the uninstall loop, anything retired earlier in the same invocation is swept in the same pass. On the audited machine that meant removing the stale `aerc`/`khal`/`vdirsyncer` trio (a complete mail+calendar setup for tools herald replaced in 7.3.0) while correctly *keeping* `cmus`/`glow`/`yazi`, which are still installed. **`~/.docker` is deliberately excluded** — it looks like Docker Desktop residue but OrbStack took it over (`currentContext: orbstack`, registry `auths`, `daemon.json`), so removing it would break the docker CLI and destroy credentials. Untapping is restricted to taps this script itself retired (`nikitabobko/tap`, `snyk/tap`) and only when they provide no installed packages, so hand-added taps are never touched (#214)
- **cleanup**: `--cleanup` now removes the **orphaned support trees left behind by the VS Code / Kiro / Cursor casks** it already uninstalls. Homebrew only ever owned the `.app`, so `~/.vscode`, `~/.kiro`, `~/.cursor` and their `~/Library/Application Support` counterparts survived every run — ~1.5 GB across 73 extension folders on the maintainer's machine, for three editors long since replaced by Helix + Claude Code. A tree is only touched when its `.app` is genuinely absent, so a manual reinstall is never gutted, and removal prefers `trash` over `rm -rf` so a mistake is recoverable (#210)

### Removed

- **dx**: **Retire Helix.** Added to `DEPRECATED_TOOLS` so `--cleanup` uninstalls it, with `~/.config/helix` added to the config-orphan sweep. Every integration was repointed to micro — `EDITOR`/`VISUAL`, `gh`, `glab`, `lazygit`, `leaf`'s `Ctrl+E`, the `$(fzf)` open alias and the health-check probe — using micro's documented `FILE +LINE` form. **The language servers stay**: they were annotated "Helix / croft use these automatically", and croft consumes them, so retiring Helix orphaned nothing. One casualty: Helix's `Alt+a` binding that piped a selection through `llm`; `croft pair` covers the IDE case and `> ! llm …` works from micro's command bar (#229)

- **shell**: Drop the **`pip` and `wget` aliases** entirely rather than merely gating them (#221). Neither binary is installed, so both aliases existed only to redirect muscle memory — and both redirected badly: `pip install X` became `uv pip install X` and failed with "No virtual environment found" (reading like a broken Python setup), while `wget -qO- URL` became an aria2c exception. A clean "command not found" is more useful than a misleading error, and the setup's own standards already mandate `uv`. `dl="aria2c"` is kept — that is a shortcut for a tool that *is* installed, not a shadow of a missing one (#222)

### Fixed

- **claude**: The generated **`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `rules/*.md` are now refreshed on every run** instead of written once. Both were guarded by `if [[ -f ]]` / `if [[ -d ]]`, so any machine provisioned once never received another correction — the maintainer's copy had drifted **33 lines** and still named eight tools the script had since removed (`aider`, `repomix`, `kew`, `aerc`, `khal`, `tmux`, `snyk`, `trippy`), meaning every CLAUDE.md fix from #209, #218, #219 and #223 was undeliverable. Same class as the `settings.json` migration gap fixed in #206. Both now go through `write_managed`, so the block refreshes in place, edits outside the markers survive, and a pre-existing unmarked file is backed up to `*.pre-managed.<timestamp>` rather than destroyed. The drift was also actively misleading: auditing the stale local copy during #209 surfaced "stale" references that had already been fixed upstream (#226)
- **claude**: The generated `CLAUDE.md` gains a section stating that this machine's dotfiles and `~/.claude/*` are generated — hand-edits between the managed markers are reverted on the next run, the fix belongs in the script's heredoc, and a tool's binary name often differs from its package name (#226)

- **docs**: Correct the `TOOL_REFERENCE.md` "Modern replacements" table, which listed rows that were never aliased at all — **`sed` → `sd`** (the `.zshrc` explicitly avoids aliasing sed because the syntax differs) and **`cd` → `zoxide`** (`cd` is untouched; zoxide adds `z`/`zi` alongside it). Same class as the CLAUDE.md line corrected in #218. The table now also states the aliases are interactive-only, and lists the tools reached by their own names instead (#222)
- **claude**: The generated `/dep-audit` command told Claude to run bare `pip audit` and `pip list --outdated`, neither of which resolves; now `uv pip` (#222)
- **python**: Document why `~/.config/pip/pip.conf` is kept despite uv being the package manager — it looks like dead weight but is not. Bare `pip` is absent, yet `pip3` ships inside Homebrew's `python@3.14` that ~20 installed formulae depend on, so it cannot be removed; `require-virtualenv = true` is what stops an absent-minded `pip3 install` from polluting that shared interpreter (#222)
- **shell**: Extend the interactive-only guard over the **entire** alias section, not just the modern-tool block — #219 covered 14 of 72 aliases, and the rest still leaked into agent shells. The worst was **`pip="uv pip"`**: an agent types `pip install` constantly and got `error: No virtual environment found`, which reads like a broken Python setup rather than an alias. **`wget="aria2c"`** and `dl` sat in a separate *Download & Transfer* section and slipped through the previous fix entirely. Also covered: the TUI launchers (`lg`, `lzd`, `hq`, `y`, `n`, `clip`, `claws`, `ghd`, `md`, `klog`) which block with no terminal attached, `update="topgrade"` (a bare `update` would start updating the whole system), the fzf-backed `a`/`ff`/`rgf` launcher functions, and `assume="source assume"`. Gating the whole section rather than a hazard list means aliases added later are covered automatically. Verified: **zero** script aliases non-interactively, all **75** restored interactively (#220)
- **shell**: The terminal welcome screen (fastfetch + date banner) now also requires an interactive shell, so sourcing the rc from a script or agent no longer emits a banner into captured output (#220)
- **shell**: Make the **modern-tool aliases interactive-only**. The generated `.zshrc` aliased 11 POSIX commands to modern replacements, and Claude Code (like any agent or script sourcing the profile) inherited all of them in a *non-interactive* shell — where **none of the replacements accept the original's flags**. `du -sh` printed dust's help text, `rm -rf` was rejected by trash, `top -l1` was an unknown argument, and worst of all `ps aux` and `dig +short` **silently ignored the argument** and returned differently-shaped output that looks correct to a parser. The block's own comment already stated the principle — "we avoid aliasing cd, sed, find, grep, diff globally since they have different syntax… and would break scripts" — it just wasn't applied to the rest. Now gated on `[[ -o interactive ]]` plus `$CLAUDECODE`/`$AI_AGENT` as a backstop; interactive use is completely unchanged (#218)
- **shell**: Agent shells keep the **Trash safety net for `rm`** without the breakage: a flag-tolerant `rm` function strips `-r`/`-f`/`-rf` (honouring `--`) and passes the paths to `trash`, so deletions stay recoverable *and* the command works. No-argument `rm -rf` is a safe no-op (#218)
- **shell**: Remove **`alias make="just"`**. It shadowed a real build tool — in any repo with a Makefile, `make build` silently ran `just build`. A footgun interactively, not only for agents; `just` remains available under its own name (#218)
- **claude**: Rewrite the generated `CLAUDE.md` "Modern replacements" line, which listed `sd`→`sed` (`sed` was never aliased) and told Claude to work around aliases it will no longer see. It now states plainly that agent shells get the real POSIX tools, that the modern tools remain available by their own names, and that `sd`/`rg` have their own syntax unrelated to `sed`/`grep` (#218)
- **claude**: Correct five tool references in the generated `CLAUDE.md` that named the **Homebrew package instead of the binary**, so Claude was being told to run commands that do not exist — `csvkit` → `csvlook`/`in2csv`/`csvjson`, `aws-sam-cli` → `sam`, `dynein` → `dy`, `nushell` → `nu`, `imagemagick` → `magick`. Same class as the `Bash(trippy *)` rule fixed in #206 (the binary is `trip`) (#209)
- **code-quality**: Install **prettier**. The generated `CLAUDE.md` mandates it, the pre-push checklist runs it, and the script already writes a global `.prettierrc` — but it was never actually installed, so the Claude `format-on-edit` hook found nothing on PATH and silently no-opped. Installed from brew so it survives mise Node switches. The hook now prefers a project's **own** prettier over the global one, so a repo pinning 2.x is not reformatted by 3.x (#209)
- **script**: `--list-categories` now renders from `CATEGORY_DESC` instead of a second hardcoded copy. The two lists had drifted apart in **seven** categories — `act3`, `ni`, `Objective-See`, `monolith`, `terminal-notifier`, `fx`, and most of `terminal-productivity` (`nnn`, `cheznav`, `apw`, `has`, `starlit`) appeared in one but not the other — so the flag and the interactive picker described the same category differently. One source of truth means it cannot recur (#209)
- **typos**: `typos .` now passes repo-wide, so the pre-push spell-check step is actionable instead of always red. Allowlisted five project-specific identifiers the default dictionary misreads: `keyward` (SSH-key manager), `clearn` (the `~/Code/learning` alias), `PNGs`, `SLQ` (sq's query language, not a transposed SQL), and `wrk` (the load-testing tool) (#209)

- **claude**: Repair the generated `settings.json` **PostToolUse hooks**, which were schema-invalid and therefore **never ran on any machine this script has provisioned**. Entries were emitted as `{matcher, command}`, but the schema requires a nested `hooks` array (`{matcher, hooks:[{type,command}]}`) — Claude Code reported `Expected array, but received undefined` and silently skipped all three hooks (auto-format, ruff, hadolint). The three entries now collapse into a single `Edit|Write` entry (#206)
- **claude**: Drop the **`fileSuggestionSettings`** key from the generated settings — Claude Code does not implement it (0 occurrences in the shipped binary), so its 20 ignore patterns were inert. Build/dependency dirs were already excluded via each repo's `.gitignore` (`respectGitignore` defaults to true); the genuinely-unfiltered noise is the *committed* kind, so the script now writes a global **`~/.ignore`** covering lock files, minified bundles, and sourcemaps instead. Note this also applies to ripgrep searches under `$HOME` (#206)
- **claude**: Retarget the generated `permissions.deny` list from **Linux to macOS** — `> /dev/sda*` → `> /dev/disk*`, `mkfs *` → `diskutil erase*` / `diskutil partitionDisk*` / `newfs_*` — and add the `rm -fr` and `~/*` spellings the original literal-prefix rules missed. These remain fat-finger guardrails, not a security boundary (#206)
- **claude**: Make the `format-on-edit.sh` prettier hook actually fire. It gated on a global `prettier` that this script never installs, so it no-opped even once wired correctly; it now falls back to the project-local copy via `npx --no-install prettier` and recognises five more config filenames (`.prettierrc.yaml/.yml/.js/.mjs`, `prettier.config.mjs`) (#206)
- **claude**: **Migrate existing installs.** The `configs` block only writes the full settings heredoc when `~/.claude/settings.json` is absent, so already-provisioned machines took the jq merge path and would never have been repaired. That path now normalizes legacy `{matcher, command}` hook entries across every hook event, drops `fileSuggestionSettings`, migrates the deny list, and strips stale allow entries (`Bash(trippy *)` — the binary is `trip` — and `Bash(wc -l *)`, already covered by `Bash(wc *)`). The migration is idempotent and leaves user-added rules and custom keys untouched (#206)

## [7.5.0] - 2026-08-10

Deepens the Claude Code integration: a scoped set of Google Workspace (`gws`) skills, four first-party skills for installed tools (`office-docs`, `d2-diagrams`, `dbmate-migrations`, `api-testing`), and a project `CLAUDE.md`. Also fixes the global pre-commit hook's false positives and switches the terminal to a Nerd Font. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **claude**: Add three more first-party skills for installed tools — **`d2-diagrams`** (diagrams as code: d2 primary, mermaid fallback), **`dbmate-migrations`** (schema migrations following the global DB conventions), and **`api-testing`** (headless HTTP/gRPC via hurl/xh/curlie/grpcurl; atac as the TUI) (#203)
- **claude**: Add a first-party **`office-docs` skill** (`~/.claude/skills/office-docs/`) wrapping the local Office-file render→see→assert loop (`soffice` → `pdftoppm` → `pdftotext`/`doxx` → `office-py`), scoped to local files (authoring stays in Workspace; cloud files use `gws`). The generated `CLAUDE.md` now points at it and at Claude Code's bundled `docx`/`pptx`/`xlsx`/`pdf` skills (#199)
- **docs**: Add a root **`CLAUDE.md`** documenting repo conventions for AI agents — the script is a generator (edit heredocs, not output), the managed-block/idempotency/`--dry-run` patterns, the `bash -n` + ShellCheck + `--dry-run` verification loop, the global pre-commit hook's regenerate-on-re-run behavior and `debug-ok` whitelist, heredoc quoting, changelog-on-every-PR, and the `trash`/`bat` alias gotchas (#197)
- **script**: Install a scoped set of **24 `gws` Claude skills** — 10 service skills + 14 recipes covering **Drive/Docs/Slides/Sheets/Forms only** — into `~/.claude/skills/`, refreshed each run. Gmail/Calendar/Chat/Meet skills are deliberately excluded, and `recipe-create-feedback-form` is dropped because it depends on `gws-gmail`. The generated `CLAUDE.md` now lists exactly which skills/recipes Claude has and notes that skills are not an access boundary; the post-setup checklist gains an **OAuth-fence reminder** (authorize only the five services' scopes at `gws auth setup`) (#193)

### Changed

- **ghostty**: Set the terminal `font-family` to **`JetBrainsMono Nerd Font`** (was plain `JetBrains Mono`) so glyph icons — eza, starship, lazygit, Claude Code, etc. — render natively instead of relying on font fallback. The Nerd Font was already installed and is the same family SketchyBar uses (#201)

### Fixed

- **hooks**: The global pre-commit hook is now **language-aware** — the debug-statement check scans only the file types each token belongs to (JS/TS for `console.log`/`debugger`, Python for pdb/`breakpoint()`, Ruby for `binding.pry`), so shell scripts and markdown that merely *mention* those tokens are no longer rejected (this repo's own script previously required `--no-verify`); a trailing `debug-ok` comment whitelists an intentional line. The merge-conflict-marker check is anchored to line start and requires the trailing space real markers carry, so markdown setext headings (`=======`) no longer false-flag (#195)

## [7.4.0] - 2026-08-09

Adds comprehensive on-machine tool documentation, fills gaps in the post-setup checklist, and fixes the Google Workspace CLI install. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **docs**: New Desktop doc **TOOL_REFERENCE.md** — a categorized reference of every user-facing installed tool (~195 entries) with a plain-English description and worked usage examples, generated fresh on every run alongside the other Desktop docs (#190)
- **checklist**: The manual auth/first-run steps that were missing — `gh auth login` (the PR workflow assumed it), AWS auth (`aws configure sso` / `granted` / `assume`, plus `steampipe plugin install aws`), and optional `atuin` cross-machine history sync (#190)

### Changed

- **docs**: `TOOLKIT_SUMMARY.md` now points at `TOOL_REFERENCE.md` so its curation is intentional; clarify the window-management wording in the generated CLAUDE.md to `native macOS Spaces + built-in window tiling (no tiling WM)` now that AeroSpace is gone (#190, #186)

### Fixed

- **script**: Install the **`googleworkspace-cli`** formula for the `gws` command instead of Homebrew's core `gws` (which is *git-workspace*, an unrelated tool); the two share a `gws` binary and conflict, so the conflicting formula is removed first and existing machines self-correct on the next run (#188, #189)

## [7.3.0] - 2026-08-09

Captures the maintainer's macOS defaults, drops AeroSpace in favor of native Spaces + Zellij, and fixes several login/MCP papercuts. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **macos**: Capture this machine's Finder, trackpad, and appearance settings so fresh installs reproduce them — Finder view settings (Desktop + "Use as Defaults" for all windows), desktop drive visibility, new-window target, keep the empty-trash warning; trackpad tap-to-click/secondary-click/gesture prefs; and **Dark mode** (#180)

### Changed

- **wm**: Remove **AeroSpace** — window management moves to **Zellij** (terminal density) + **native macOS Spaces & tiling** (GUI). SketchyBar stays, minus the workspace pills; revert `spans-displays` so multi-monitor gets per-display Spaces back; keep `mru-spaces=false` (fixed Space order). AeroSpace added to `--cleanup` so existing machines uninstall it (#182)
- **filesystem**: Consolidate `~/Docs` into the default `~/Documents` (reverses the 6.0.0 rename) — one Documents folder, sidebar de-duplicated; life-admin buckets + tiki notes repo move under `~/Documents` (#178)
- **sketchybar**: Wifi pill is icon-only — drop the SSID label from the menu bar (#179)

### Fixed

- **mcp**: The github / cloudwatch / iam MCP servers now register — `claude mcp add`'s variadic `-e` flag was eating the server name; reordered to `<name> ... -e KEY=val --` (#177)
- **ghostty**: Auto-start launches Ghostty in the **background** (`open -g`) instead of hidden (`-gj`) so the global cmd+space quick-terminal hotkey registers after login (it never did from a hidden launch) (#183)
- **script**: Restore the executable bit on `setup-dev-tools-mac.sh` (#181); drop the stale "hot corners" line from the run summary and suppress the `universalaccess` write error (#176)

## [7.2.0] - 2026-08-09

Makes a batch of installed tools actually work out of the box, hardens macOS/login integration, and reconciles the README with the script. No breaking changes.

### Added

- **ghostty**: Auto-start Ghostty at login via a LaunchAgent so the global `cmd+space` quick-terminal hotkey survives logout/reboot (#145)
- **leaf**: Point leaf's `Ctrl+E` editor at Helix instead of nano — leaf ignores `$EDITOR`, so `~/.config/leaf/config.toml` now sets `editor = 'hx {$path}:{$line}'` (#147)
- **git**: Set the personal identity as the **global default** committer so commits outside `~/Code/{work,personal}` still work; the work `includeIf` still overrides it there (#172)
- **macos**: Auto-disable Spotlight's `cmd+space` (symbolichotkeys 64/65) so it no longer collides with Ghostty; register Quick Look generators with `qlmanage -r` so `.md`/plain-text previews activate immediately (#167)
- **backups**: Scaffold a commented `~/.config/borgmatic/config.yaml`; seed ClamAV's `freshclam.conf` and register a daily virus-DB updater LaunchAgent (#171)
- **theme**: Dracula theming for trippy (`theme-colors`), d2 (`$D2_THEME`), and claws (`--theme dracula`) (#172)

### Changed

- **llm**: Install `llm` via `uv tool ... --with llm-anthropic` instead of Homebrew (brew's externally-managed llm can't install the plugin) and default the model to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`, so the Helix `Alt+a` pipe reaches Claude (#166)
- **commitizen / tflint / act / pandoc**: Wire the `cz-conventional-changelog` adapter (`~/.czrc`); write `~/.tflint.hcl` with the AWS ruleset (`tflint --init`); add `--container-architecture linux/amd64` to `~/.actrc`; install `tectonic` so pandoc can render PDFs (#166)
- **macos**: Gate the Time Machine exclusions on a configured TM destination (skip when unused — backups run via borg/rclone/rsync); drop the hot-corner defaults (macOS default is already off), keeping only `mru-spaces=false` as a required AeroSpace prerequisite (#173)

### Fixed

- **shell**: Source fzf before atuin so atuin owns `Ctrl-R` (was shadowed by fzf); de-duplicate the direnv hook (`.zprofile` + `.zshrc` fired it twice); add `alias assume="source assume"` so granted can export AWS creds into the shell (#165)
- **docs**: Document the Shottr Screen Recording and SketchyBar Automation/Accessibility permissions in the post-setup checklist; flag the infracost API key (#167, #171)
- **readme**: Reconcile the README with the script — correct the Claude Code permission allowlist (read-only/scoped, not full write access) and its counts, the Apple-bloat table (GarageBand only, no SIP), removed wallpaper/hot-corner claims, and add missing tools, config files, aliases, and the herald MCP server (#173, #174)

## [6.0.0] - 2026-07-27

**BREAKING:** Removes the `mac-communication` category (both Slack and Telegram are dropped), so `--only mac-communication` / `--skip mac-communication` are no longer valid category names. Also restructures the `~/` filesystem layout (see Changed) — re-running on an existing machine creates the new folders alongside the old ones; it does not migrate or delete existing files. Curates the installed app set for a solo fractional CIO/CTO consulting workflow (Google Workspace); run `--cleanup` to uninstall the retired apps (#39).

### Added

- **editor**: Re-add `visual-studio-code`, installed alongside Kiro and sharing a single extension list (`EDITOR_EXTENSIONS`) via a new `install_editor_extensions` helper — Kiro resolves from OpenVSX, VS Code from the Microsoft Marketplace. Grants `Bash(code *)` in the Claude Code allowlist (#39)
- **apps**: Add `bruno` (local-first, git-friendly API client), `dbeaver-community` (universal DB GUI), `cyberduck` (SFTP/S3/cloud transfer), `shottr` (native screenshots with scrolling capture + OCR), and `drawio` (offline architecture/system diagrams) (#39)
- **filesystem**: Add an `~/Inbox` dump zone, pinned first (with `~/Downloads`) in the Finder sidebar, for a lower-friction, ADD-friendly layout. Starship gains `Inbox`/`Docs`/`Archive` directory icons (#39)
- **claude**: Expand the generated global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — a fuller Environment section plus a new Working Context section (Google Workspace, open-source/CLI/privacy/minimal tooling philosophy, and the ADD-friendly home-folder layout) (#39)

### Changed

- **filesystem**: Restructure `~/` for fewer top-level roots and shallower nesting — `~/Documents` (10 nested subfolders) becomes a flat `~/Docs` (finance, health, admin, receipts, travel); `~/Reference`, `~/Projects`, and `~/Creative/assets/*` are collapsed; `~/Archive` becomes a single bucket. `~/Code` is intentionally unchanged (aliases, per-directory git identity, mise/direnv trust, and the MCP filesystem scope depend on it) (#39)
- **api**: Replace `postman` with `bruno`. **database**: replace `tableplus` with `dbeaver-community`. **file-transfer**: replace `transmit` with `cyberduck`. **screenshots**: replace `snagit` with `shottr`. Each retired tool's `--cleanup` entry now points at its replacement (#39)

### Removed

- **apps**: Drop `brave-browser`, `firefox`, `slack`, `telegram`, `notion-mail`, and `libreoffice` from install (all moved to the `--cleanup` deprecation list). `zed` added to `--cleanup` as well (it was never installed by the script) (#39)
- **mas**: Drop the `mas` (Mac App Store CLI) install entirely — nothing was being installed via the App Store anymore, which had left `mas` both installed and marked-for-removal. `--cleanup` still removes any leftover `mas` and old App Store apps via the `/Applications` fallback. Removes `Bash(mas *)` from the Claude Code allowlist (#39)
- **category**: Remove the now-empty `mac-communication` category (#39)

## [5.0.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **script**: Interactive category picker — run with `--interactive` / `-i` to select which categories to install from a checkbox menu instead of passing `--only` / `--skip` (closes #35, #36)

## [4.1.0] - 2026-05-10

Minor release rolling up two follow-up PRs to v4.0.0: a tool-discoverability audit (#31) and the AWS MCP / toolkit fleet (#32). Fully backward-compatible.

### Added

- **kiro/mcp**: Add 11 AWS MCP servers backed by [awslabs/mcp](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/). Five enabled by default (read-only or autoApprove-reads-only): `aws-pricing` (no AWS creds needed), `aws-iac` (CDK + Terraform + CloudFormation patterns, replaces the deprecated cdk-mcp-server), `aws-knowledge` (broader knowledge base), `cloudwatch` (Logs/Metrics queries, read ops only auto-approved), `iam` (read/simulate only auto-approved — every mutation still prompts). Six written disabled-by-default for opt-in per workspace: `aws-ccapi` (Cloud Control API CRUD), `aws-serverless` (SAM lifecycle), `aws-lambda-tool` (call deployed Lambdas as agent tools), `aws-eks`, `aws-ecs`, `aws-dynamodb`. All use `${AWS_REGION}` / `${AWS_PROFILE}` from the launching shell (#32)
- **kiro/extensions**: Add `amazonwebservices.aws-toolkit-vscode` (local Lambda debugging via SAM, CloudFormation/SAM YAML schemas, ECS exec terminal, AWS resource explorer, credential/SSO management) and `kddejong.vscode-cfn-lint` (template linter, pairs with the `cfn-lint` CLI). Both verified on OpenVSX (#32)
- **docs**: README documents the AWS credential setup chain (`aws configure`, AWS SSO via `granted`/`assume`, explicit env vars) and the Notion integration sharing model (#32)

### Fixed

- **path**: Add `~/.local/bin` to `.zprofile` and the managed `.zshrc` block. `uv tool install` (and `pipx`) put persistent binaries there — without this, `harlequin` and anything else the user installs via `uv tool install` was unreachable as a bare command (#31)
- **kiro/mcp**: Pre-expand `npx` and `uvx` to absolute paths in `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`. Kiro is a GUI app; when launched from Finder, Spotlight, or Raycast it inherits launchd's restricted PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), not the user's interactive shell PATH. Bare `"command": "npx"` silently failed to spawn MCP servers for any user who didn't launch Kiro from a terminal — the most common launch path. Same well-known issue as Claude Desktop. Resolution chain falls back to `/opt/homebrew/bin` then `/usr/local/bin` if `brew --prefix` fails (#31)
- **claude**: Refresh the Claude Code Bash permission allowlist with 36 entries covering v4.0.0 additions (`kiro`, `aider`, `llm`, `repomix`, `uvx`) plus 30+ tools installed by earlier versions that had never been allowlisted (`mas`, `dockutil`, `terminal-notifier`, `harlequin`, `granted`, `assume`, `topgrade`, `git-absorb`, `mkcert`, `mitmproxy`, `bandwhich`, `nmap`, `procs`, `btop`, `trash`, `yt-dlp`, `parallel`, `lnav`, `glow`, `fastfetch`, etc.). 169 allow entries total. `claude *` deliberately excluded as recursive (#31)

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-10

**BREAKING:** VS Code is replaced with **Kiro** (AWS's agentic IDE — VS Code fork with built-in Claude agent, specs, steering, hooks, MCP). Re-running the script on a v3.x machine will leave VS Code in place but switch the toolchain (`EDITOR`, lazygit, yazi, `gh`) to point at `kiro`. Run `--cleanup` to also uninstall the now-deprecated `visual-studio-code` cask.

### Changed

- **editor**: Replace `visual-studio-code` cask with `kiro`. Settings move from `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/` to `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro/User/`. CLI symlink installs into `$(brew --prefix)/bin/kiro` so it lands on PATH on both Apple Silicon and Intel. `EDITOR`/`VISUAL`, `gh editor`, lazygit edit/editAtLine, and yazi opener all switch from `code` to `kiro` (#24)
- **extensions**: Curate the auto-installed extension list for **OpenVSX** (Kiro's registry — Microsoft Marketplace closed-source extensions are unavailable). Drop `github.copilot` (Kiro ships its own Claude agent, redundant). Add `charliermarsh.ruff`, `astro-build.astro-vscode`, `svelte.svelte-vscode`, `editorconfig.editorconfig`, `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint`, `hashicorp.terraform` (#24)
- **keybindings**: Keep the 21 VS Code muscle-memory bindings; add three Kiro-specific ones — `⌘I` (open agent chat), `⌘⇧I` (inline edit with agent), `⌘⇧S` (create a spec from a one-line ask) (#24)
- **gitignore template**: Editor section now covers both `.vscode/` and `.kiro/` layouts; `.kiro/.cache`, `.kiro/.tmp`, `.kiro/local` are ignored while `.kiro/steering`, `.kiro/specs`, `.kiro/hooks`, and `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` stay version-controlled by default (#24)
- **terminal welcome**: Skip the fastfetch banner in both `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode` and `TERM_PROGRAM=kiro` integrated terminals (#24)
- **docs**: Replace VS Code sections in README, GUIDE, and SHORTCUTS with Kiro equivalents — covering OpenVSX, the four agent primitives (steering / specs / hooks / MCP), the Kiro + Claude Code workflow, and the new keybindings (#24)

### Added

- **kiro/mcp**: Auto-write a global MCP server config at `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with sensible defaults — **filesystem, github, git, fetch, context7, aws-docs, notion** enabled and **playwright, postgres** written disabled (opt-in). Token references (`${GITHUB_TOKEN}`, `${NOTION_TOKEN}`) are kept literal so Kiro substitutes them at runtime; `$HOME` is pre-expanded at install time so the filesystem server gets a real path (#24)
- **dx**: Add agentic AI CLIs that pair with Claude Code + Kiro — `aider` (terminal AI pair programmer with git-aware edit loops), `llm` (Simon Willison's CLI for one-shot prompts, plugins, SQLite logging, embeddings), `repomix` (pack a repo into a single LLM-friendly file with token counts) (#26, #29)
- **iac**: Add `terraform-docs` (auto-generate module README sections from variables/outputs) and `checkov` (IaC static analysis — Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Dockerfile). Note: `tfsec` is no longer installed standalone — its checks are folded into `trivy config`, which is already installed under `security`. Wired into the iac rules, the `/iac-review` slash command (now runs both trivy + checkov + terraform-docs), and the Claude Code Bash allowlist (#27, #29)

### Fixed

- **state**: Truncate `~/.local/share/dev-setup/completed-items.txt` on non-resume runs. `mark_done` always appends; `is_done` only checks the state file when `--resume` is passed. Without truncation, the file grew unbounded across repeated runs. `--resume` runs are preserved so previous successes can short-circuit (#28, #29)

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- **Dock**: Stop pinning a curated app list (Finder, System Settings, VS Code, Ghostty, Raycast) on setup — Dock contents are personal preference. Enable Dock auto-hide by default (`com.apple.dock autohide = true`). `dockutil` is still installed for manual Dock management (#20)
- **ci**: Bump GitHub Actions runtimes to Node 24 (#18)

### Added

- **repo**: Version-controlled GitHub repository ruleset for `main` at `.github/rulesets/main.json` (PR-only, squash-merge, ShellCheck required, force pushes / branch deletion blocked, linear history, admin bypass) plus apply/update instructions in `.github/rulesets/README.md`. Already applied live (#22)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **tools**: Add `mas` (Mac App Store CLI), `dockutil` (Dock management), and `terminal-notifier` (macOS notifications) to the `mac-system` category (#15, #16)
- **script**: Emit a macOS notification at end of run — success notification with install/skip/fail counts and duration, or failure notification with error log path if any step errored (uses `terminal-notifier`, no-op if not installed)

### Changed

- **Dock**: Replace the `defaults write persistent-apps -array` clearing block with a `dockutil` sequence that removes all defaults then pins a curated set (Finder, System Settings, VS Code, Ghostty, Raycast). Any app not present on disk is skipped with a warning, so partial installs still succeed. Falls back to the previous clear-only behavior if `dockutil` isn't installed (#15, #16)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-23

**BREAKING:** Linux and Windows support removed. This is now a macOS-only project.

### Added

- **tools**: Add `ouch` (universal archive tool) and `harlequin` (terminal SQL IDE) to the macOS setup, with `hq` alias and Dracula-themed `~/.config/harlequin/config.toml` (#11)
- **repo**: Wire up `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (shellcheck via `shellcheck-py`, gitleaks, typos, file-hygiene hooks) and `.typos.toml` (#11)

### Removed

- **platforms**: Drop Linux and Windows support (#12, #13). Deleted `scripts/setup-dev-tools-linux.sh`, `scripts/setup-dev-tools-windows.ps1`, and their per-platform `docs/GUIDE-*` / `docs/SHORTCUTS-*` files. Remaining macOS docs renamed to `docs/GUIDE.md` and `docs/SHORTCUTS.md`. CI workflows simplified to ShellCheck-only; release workflow now produces a single macOS zip.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **api**: Replace Bruno with Postman as the API client across mac (brew cask `postman`), linux (snap/flatpak `com.getpostman.Postman`), and windows (winget `Postman.Postman`) (#8)

### Removed

- **editors**: Remove Zed editor install and `~/.config/zed/settings.json` config block from all three setup scripts; VS Code is now the sole configured editor (#8)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Features

- **browsers**: Add Carbonyl (Chromium-based terminal browser) to mac/linux/windows browsers categories (#1)
- **tools**: Add seven terminal CLI tools across platforms (#3):
  - `w3m` and `monolith` in browsers
  - `cmus` in media
  - `nnn` and `progress` in terminal-productivity (mac + linux)
  - `act3` in code-quality
  - `sshclick` in networking (linux only)
- **aliases**: Add `gha3` → `act3` (all platforms); `n` → `nnn -de`, `prog` → `progress -m` (mac + linux); `sshc` → `sshclick` (linux) (#5)
- **configs**: Generate default `~/.config/cmus/rc` (Dracula palette, replaygain) and `~/.w3m/config` (UTF-8, cookies off) on mac + linux (#5)
- **configs**: Export `NNN_OPTS`, `NNN_COLORS`, `NNN_FCOLORS`, `NNN_PLUG` in managed zshrc block (#5)

### Documentation

- Document all new tools in `GUIDE-MACOS.md`, `GUIDE-LINUX.md`, `GUIDE-WINDOWS.md` with usage examples (#5)
- Update `SHORTCUTS-*.md` with new alias rows and a "Terminal Apps" section (#5)

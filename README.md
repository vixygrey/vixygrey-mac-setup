A single setup script that installs and configures a curated macOS development environment. It covers development, GitHub, AWS/CDK, infrastructure, security, backup, and daily productivity.

Homebrew is the primary package manager. npm, Cargo, Go, uv, the OMP plugin manager, upstream installers, and pinned source builds cover packages outside Homebrew.

## Documentation

- [Shortcuts](docs/SHORTCUTS.md) -- keyboard shortcuts and shell aliases reference

## Project structure

The script is the product. The other tracked files define its assets, generated outputs, documentation, tests, and workflows.

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| [`scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh`](scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh) | The generator and installer |
| [`assets/`](assets/) | Files copied onto provisioned machines |
| [`config/generated-outputs.tsv`](config/generated-outputs.tsv) | Generated-output policy and verification inventory |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | User reference documents |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Procedural rules: workflow, commands, verification loop |
| [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md) | Normative rules: how the code must look and behave |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | How to open a change, for humans |
| [`.github/`](.github/) | CI, issue templates, pull request template, and branch rules |
| [`Justfile`](Justfile) | Local commands. Run `just preflight` before any commit. |
| [`tests/`](tests/) | Helper unit tests and the Homebrew name check |

## Quick Start

> **Before you start:** macOS ships `bash` 3.2, but this script needs **bash 4+**.
> If `bash --version` shows 3.2, install Homebrew if needed, then run
> `brew install bash` before starting setup.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh
```

A few good first commands after setup:

```bash
actionlint                              # lint GitHub Actions workflows
duckdb                                  # local SQL shell for CSV/JSON/Parquet
ps aux | jc --ps | jq '.[0]'            # classic command output -> JSON
yaml-py -c 'import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load("a: 1"))'
omp config get modelRoles               # which model each OMP role uses
```

## Bootstrap trust model

This repo is a bootstrapper, so a few first-run install paths intentionally trust
upstream installer scripts rather than shipping vendored payloads here. Today that
includes:

- **Homebrew** — fetched from Homebrew's official install script
- **rustup** — fetched from `sh.rustup.rs`
- **pnpm** — fetched from `get.pnpm.io/install.sh`

Those installer payloads are **not checksum-pinned by this repo today**. That is a
practical trade for a one-command setup script, not a claim that the risk is zero.
If you want to inspect first, run `--dry-run`, read `scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh`,
and prefer tagged release artifacts with the published SHA256 checksum.

## CLI Options

```bash
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --help              # Show all options
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --dry-run           # Preview changes without installing
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --no-prompt         # Disable interactive prompts
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --interactive       # Choose categories interactively
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --list              # List declared Homebrew and npm packages
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --resume            # Continue from where a previous run left off
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --uninstall         # Show commands to remove everything (no changes made)
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --cleanup           # Remove tools from previous versions no longer in script
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --verify            # Check supported generated configs with installed consumers
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --list-categories   # List all available categories
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --skip mac-media,mac-cloud  # Skip specific categories
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --only core,git,aws,dx      # Only install specific categories
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --version           # Show script version
```

> macOS-only categories use the `mac-*` prefix (e.g., `--skip mac-media`).

> **A category installs its tools; it does not configure them.** Every generated
> config file is written in the `configs` category (plus starship in `dracula`,
> `~/Scripts` in `filesystem`, and `~/.zshrc` in `shell`). The run prints a
> reminder when `--only` would skip the configuration for a selected category.

## What It Does

1. **Pre-flight checks** -- verifies macOS version, disk space, internet, admin privileges
2. Installs tools through idempotent Homebrew, npm, Cargo, Go, uv, OMP plugin, and upstream installer paths, plus pinned source builds
3. Writes managed defaults for supported tools and preserves user-owned settings
4. Applies a cohesive **Dracula-Sakura** theme across the terminal, editor, and TUI surfaces
5. Sets macOS system defaults (Dock, keyboard, Finder, screenshots, screensaver, etc.)
6. Configures Finder sidebar with custom favorites via **LSSharedFileList** API
7. Configures Dock size, recent-app visibility, and minimize behavior while keeping auto-hide and pins unchanged
8. Auto-writes `~/.zshrc` with a managed block (preserves your customizations)
9. Exports a `Brewfile` snapshot (with descriptions) for reproducibility
10. **Post-install verification** -- verifies critical tools work
11. Runs `brew cleanup` and `brew doctor`
12. **Logs everything** to `~/.local/share/dev-setup/` for debugging
13. Reports final summary with install/skip/fail counts and duration

The setup copies the shared Oh My Pi `AGENTS.md` instructions into Kiro's global steering directory at `~/.kiro/steering/AGENTS.md`.

The setup merges schema-derived defaults for every configurable extension. It disables extension telemetry and remote XML resources, keeps preview scripts disabled, and preserves user settings.

### Tools that cannot take the house theme

Checked and recorded so they are not re-investigated each release. Every check
used a control: a deliberately invalid value had to be **rejected** before
acceptance of a valid one meant anything.

| Tool | Why not |
|------|---------|
| `duf` | preset flags only (`dark\|light\|ansi`) with no custom palette |
| `fx` | numbered built-in themes via `FX_THEME="0"`; no custom theme definition |
| `procs` | indexed color only (`Color256`), so the palette can only use nearest terminal indices |
| `viddy`, `cheznav`, `lazynpm`, `lazyrsync`, `lazyssh` | no theming found in their help or configuration schemas |
| `mullvad-tui`, Mullvad VPN | Both clients use fixed application colors and expose no theme configuration |
| `chamber` | Its current configuration schema exposes no theme settings |
| Bitwarden, Docker Desktop | Appearance belongs to application or profile state, which the generator does not overwrite |

`stu` and `e1s` are themed but carry **no `--verify` row**. Both are TUIs with no
validate mode, and without a TTY they panic inside crossterm before config parsing
is reached — a correct config and a deliberately broken one produce the identical
panic, so a row built on that would prove nothing.

## Filesystem Structure

The scripts create a deliberately **ADD-friendly** directory layout: few top-level
roots, shallow nesting, no overlapping categories, and an `~/Inbox` dump zone so
nothing has to be filed in the moment. When in doubt, drop it in `Inbox` (or use
Spotlight to find things) rather than agonizing over where it "should" go.

```
~/
|-- Inbox/                       # Dump zone — drop ANYTHING here, sort later or never
|
|-- Code/                        # -- Development (unchanged) --

### Directory Shortcut Aliases

| Alias | Directory |
|-------|-----------|
| `cw` | `~/Code/work` |
| `cper` | `~/Code/personal` |
| `coss` | `~/Code/oss` |
| `clearn` | `~/Code/learning` |
| `cscratch` | `~/Code/work/scratch` |
| `cscripts` | `~/Scripts` |

### Per-Directory Git Identity

Automatically uses different git identities for work vs personal:

```
~/Code/work/     -> uses ~/.gitconfig-work     (work email)
~/Code/personal/ -> uses ~/.gitconfig-personal  (personal email)
```

The **personal** identity is also set as the **global default**, so commits outside those two trees (`~/Code/oss`, `~/Inbox`, `/tmp`, …) still have a committer -- the `~/Code/work` include still overrides it there. The script prompts for your name/email interactively; you can also edit `~/.gitconfig-work` / `~/.gitconfig-personal` afterward.

## AI and editors

### AI agents

**Oh My Pi** (`omp`) is the primary coding agent.

The setup builds llama.cpp from source with Vulkan enabled and Metal disabled.
Run `./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --with-services` to create the local services.
The llama.cpp service exposes Qwen2.5 Coder 14B at `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.
The Clipse listener captures clipboard history at login.

```bash
omp
omp config get modelRoles
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/models | jq
```

OMP installs from the `can1357/tap` Homebrew tap as a prebuilt binary.
The OMP runtime remains available to shells, git hooks, and launchd jobs.

GPT-5.6-Terra handles ordinary interactive turns. GPT-5.6-Sol handles delegated tasks.
Gemini handles vision and low-cost roles. Claude Sonnet handles slow and planning work.
Automatic reasoning handles ordinary turns.
Usage-aware fallback preserves 10 percent of coding-plan quotas.
MiniMax Code is disabled. Provider prompt-cache retention stays on automatic defaults.

Each hosted model falls back to another provider before local Qwen 2.5 Coder.
The `LLAMA_CPP_BASE_URL` variable points OMP to the Vulkan service on port 8081.

OMP also carries the Dracula-Sakura theme and the generated `AGENTS.md`.
The shared skill directory is `~/.agents/skills/`.
It contains `api-testing`, `d2-diagrams`, `inspect-machine`, and `office-layout-check`.

**Web search is built in.** `web_search` exposes selectable provider backends. This setup configures
`http://127.0.0.1:8080` as the preferred SearXNG endpoint but does not install or manage
that service. Keyless backends remain available when the local endpoint is unavailable.

The `~/.omp/agent/AGENTS.md` file has the highest precedence among user context files.
OMP owns `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`, so this setup merges managed values into that file.

The `protected-paths.ts` extension blocks native file mutations to credential stores,
dependency trees, and repository metadata. It checks resolved paths to catch symlink
escapes. It does not claim to sandbox Bash or Eval, which remain under omp approval
policies.

**Authentication is yours.** The setup seeds blank `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` entries in `~/.omp/agent/.env` once.
It never reads or overwrites an existing file.
Paste each key after the matching equals sign. OMP loads this file directly.

> `modelRoles` is a **record**, so it reads as a whole and not by sub-key.
> `omp config get modelRoles.default` answers `Unknown setting`, which reports a
> schema shape rather than a missing value.

## Chrome Extensions (manual install)

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **axe DevTools** | Accessibility testing |
| **React Developer Tools** | React component inspection |

---

## Terminal and Search

| Key / command | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| `cmd + space` | Open Spotlight for application, file, and web search |
| `ff` | Find a file and open it |
| `rgf <q>` / `s <q>` | Search file content or the Spotlight index |
| `clip` | Clipboard history (clipse) |
| `lazydocker` | Docker TUI |

See `~/Desktop/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md` (generated on setup) for the full list.

## Restoring on a New Machine

```bash
# Option 1: Run the full script
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh

# Option 2: Resume after a failure
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --resume

# Option 3: Restore from Brewfile (packages only, no configs)
brew bundle install --file=~/.config/brewfile/Brewfile

# Option 4: Restore dotfiles via chezmoi
chezmoi init <your-github-username> && chezmoi apply

# Option 5: Run only specific categories
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --only core,git,dx,configs
```

---

## Updating

```bash
# Update everything at once (via topgrade)
topgrade

# Or update manually
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup

# Re-run this script to pick up new tools/configs
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh
```

The script will:
- Skip already-installed tools
- Update the `~/.zshrc` managed block
- Export a fresh Brewfile
- Apply any new macOS defaults
- Report what changed

---

## Uninstalling

```bash
# Show removal commands (no changes made)
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --uninstall
```

This prints a full guide for removing all installed tools, configs, and settings. Review each command before running.

---

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Inspect the failure log
cat ~/.local/share/dev-setup/setup-*.log | grep ERROR

# Check Homebrew health
brew doctor

# Resume after a failure (skips already-completed steps)
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --resume

# Preview without changes
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --dry-run

# Run only specific categories (add `configs` to refresh their config too)
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --only core,git,dx,configs

# Show removal commands
./scripts/setup-dev-tools-mac.sh --uninstall
```

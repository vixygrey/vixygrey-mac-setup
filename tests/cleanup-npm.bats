# End-to-end tests for the `npm` arm of the --cleanup dispatch (#399).
#
# These do NOT use SETUP_LIB_ONLY: the dispatch is inline in the --cleanup block,
# and the lib-only guard returns at line ~1316, well before it. The block is
# self-contained though — it runs and `exit 0`s ahead of both preflight and
# acquire_lock — so invoking the real script with --cleanup is safe, needs no
# lock, and exercises the actual `case` rather than a copy of it.
#
# Every test runs against a stubbed PATH in a temp $HOME. `npm` is a recording
# stub, so "did it try to uninstall?" is an assertion rather than an inference.
